The duration of this stay varies widely across EU countries. For instance, Denmark extends this privilege for up to six months, while Germany offers an extended window of up to 18 months.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Visa extensions and residence permits: The mechanisms for facilitating this transition also differ. This opportunity is seamlessly integrated into the student residence visa extension in some EU nations. In some other countries, non-EU\/EEA graduates may need to obtain a separate temporary residence permit.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Dedicated job search permits: Some EU countries take the concept a step further by introducing dedicated job search permits.
