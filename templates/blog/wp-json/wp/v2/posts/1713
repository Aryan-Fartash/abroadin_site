Moratorium Period<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">It is when the borrower need not make any repayment to the bank. This period varies from bank to bank and could last up to some time after completing the course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">2. The Margin of Loans for Study Abroad<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Usually, banks do not provide the total amount needed to fund education. Most public banks issue 90% of the total amount, and the remaining 10% has to be arranged by the applicant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">3. Effect of Exchange Rate<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Always calculate the amount you will receive at the time of disbursement, as any change in the rate may affect the applicant\u2019s amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">4. Collateral Rules of Loans for Study Abroad<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Whether movable or immovable, any property can be offered to a bank as a security for a loan is collateral. Most Indian banks demand collateral as security to reduce the risk involved in paying off the credit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Any liquid assets like bonds, FD, shares, or immovable property like the house, commercial property, or just land can be classified as collateral.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">One crucial point to remember is that banks don\u2019t accept agricultural land as collateral.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Bonds, deposits, shares, mutual fund units, gold, debentures, bank deposits, life insurance policy, and government securities, are accepted as collateral.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">5. Guarantor Responsibilities<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Becoming a loan guarantor is a great responsibility as the guarantor will have a legal obligation to pay if the borrower doesn\u2019t. If the loan amount surpasses INR 4 lakhs, the bank may ask for a guarantee from a third party.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">If the borrower cannot repay the loan amount irrespective of the circumstances, in that case, the guarantor holds the liability to reimburse the entire amount to banks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">6. Read the Agreement Carefully<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">It is one of the most important aspects to look after while taking a loan. It\u2019s always best to go through the terms and conditions of the loan carefully and then move ahead with it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">We stress it upon one factor, as you should always be transparent with all the requirements mentioned in the loan agreement. If you have any uncertainties, consult the experts apart from the bank representative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">7. The Maximum Loan Amount<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The banks set no limit for offering education loans to students abroad. It depends on the bank to bank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The majority of the banks provide loans maximum up to INR 20 to 30 lakhs. Also, if the loan is more than INR 20 lakhs, then the interest rate increases respectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1717\" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/abstract-financial-freedom-still-life-assortment-2-1.jpg\" alt=\" Loans for Study Abroad\" width=\"1248\" height=\"832\" srcset=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/abstract-financial-freedom-still-life-assortment-2-1.jpg 1248w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/abstract-financial-freedom-still-life-assortment-2-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/abstract-financial-freedom-still-life-assortment-2-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/abstract-financial-freedom-still-life-assortment-2-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Studying abroad can be a huge decision, however, for everyone.
