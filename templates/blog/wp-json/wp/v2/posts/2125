Most of the students from India, around 94,000, want to study at the graduate level after completing their first degree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The next big group is students doing an OPT internship (Optional Practical Training). These students might still be studying at their American university or have just finished their studies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Most Indian students who go to the US, around 80%, are interested in subjects like science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM). Only a small group, about 10%, come to study business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The states that attract the most international students, including those from India, are California, Massachusetts, New York, Illinois, Texas, and Pennsylvania. These states have more than 50,000 students from different countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Although the US Department of State doesn&#8217;t share the exact number of visa applications or how many were declined, they mention that more than 816,000 visas were given by US embassies and consulates in India in 2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2127\" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/visa-application-composition-with-american-flag-1.jpg\" alt=\"us student visa for indian students\" width=\"821\" height=\"548\" srcset=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/visa-application-composition-with-american-flag-1.jpg 821w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/visa-application-composition-with-american-flag-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/visa-application-composition-with-american-flag-1-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 821px) 100vw, 821px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What is the USA Study Visa Process?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Getting US student visa for Indian students is relatively easy, but following all the requirements and giving yourself enough time for paperwork is essential.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Before applying for your F-1 student visa, ensure you&#8217;ve been accepted into a recognized US college or university degree program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There are two types of student visas for Indian students going to the USA: F-1 and M-1. If you&#8217;re taking academic courses at a recognized institution for a degree, you&#8217;ll need an F-1 visa. For vocational or nonacademic classes, an M-1 visa is required. It includes university, high school, language training, and more programs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Applying for your USA student visa online is straightforward. Follow these steps for the USA study visa process in 2024:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Complete the online non-immigrant visa application with form DS-160.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Upload a photograph within the specified size limit.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Fill in the required details, upload documents, and submit the application.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Print the application form for your visa interview.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Schedule a visa interview at your nearest US Consulate or Embassy. Applying from a different country may be challenging.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Pay the non-refundable student visa application fee of USD 160.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Pay the one-time SEVIS fee for F-1, J-1, or M-1 status.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Gather all necessary documents for the interview.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Attend the interview.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The time for USA study visa process varies, usually taking three to five weeks on average. Applying early allows ample processing time and the opportunity to correct mistakes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Once accepted, the Consulate will deliver documents of US student visa for Indian students in approximately two working days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">While international F-1 visa holders are not legally obligated to possess international medical or health insurance, it is advisable for peace of mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Additionally, many universities in the US mandate an active insurance plan before allowing enrollment in classes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/why-study-in-the-usa\/\">Why study in USA?<\/a> If you interested in study in USA, you should read this\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vB5BqBAMem\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/why-study-in-the-usa\/\">Why Study in the USA | 7 Reasons to Pack Your Bags Today!<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why Study in the USA | 7 Reasons to Pack Your Bags Today!&#8221; &#8212; Abroadin \" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/why-study-in-the-usa\/embed\/#?secret=t5gEQkK6Yu#?secret=vB5BqBAMem\" data-secret=\"vB5BqBAMem\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What are the USA Study Visa Requirements?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You might have to wait between 12 days (in Chennai\/Madras) and 36 days (in Hyderabad) to meet the interview of US student visa for Indian students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Wait times can change, so booking your US visa appointment early is essential.

They allowed an extension of 17 months for OPT, making it 29 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The reason was to fill the time gap for students who finished their OPT and didn&#8217;t have a chance to apply for an H1B visa because of certain time limits and visa restrictions.
