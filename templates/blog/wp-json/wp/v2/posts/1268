Either way, they have to obey laws in the process.<\/p>\n<p>These regulations vary depending on the student&#8217;s home country and the destined country. This section explores some of the significant rules on the books in some popular countries for international students.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, every country updates rules frequently, so it is best to check the official websites to read the latest regulations before traveling and studying.<\/p>\n<p>As EU citizens, students have the same right to work while studying as nationals of that country. They do not need a student&#8217;s work permit, even to work full-time.<\/p>\n<p>Most European countries allow students on a visa to work part-time, but some countries place restrictions on the hours every visa holder can work.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>France<\/h3>\n<p>While studying in France, international students can work part-time even if they are in the program&#8217;s first year or are pursuing a language course.<\/p>\n<p>For non-EU citizens, they must have a student resident permit. French law authorizes international students to work 964 hours during the year, the equivalent of 60 percent of the full-time employment hours for the year.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Germany | Working Limits in Europe<\/h3>\n<p>International students outside the EU or EEA who want to study in Germany face <a href=\"https:\/\/www.make-it-in-germany.com\/en\/study-training\/studies-in-germany\/work#:~:text=Students%20from%20EU%2FEEA%20countries,can%20earn%20during%20semester%20breaks.\">work-hour restrictions.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>According to the German Academic Exchange Service, these students are limited to 120 full work days or 240 half workdays per year unless they gain special government approval.<\/p>\n<p>International students who work as research assistants on campus do not face time restrictions, although they need to consult the government during the application process.<\/p>\n<p>University career services offices are a resource that international students can tap to get further tips about looking for jobs and navigating the application process. It is a standard procedure in all European countries.<\/p>\n<p>If students are from outside the European Union but have a valid student visa, they can work 120 workdays or 240 work half-days annually. EU students can work 20 hours a week.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Russia<\/h3>\n<p>The Russian government recently prepared a proposal enabling students to work up to four hours per day or 20 hours per week outside the university without a supplementary permit.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most sought-after part-time jobs for international students in Russia is language teaching. Russians pay decent money to learn a language from a native. Depending on experience and the level of the student, they could be paid up to USD 50 an hour.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Spain | Working Limits in Europe<\/h3>\n<p>A non-European citizen can work up to 20 hours per week in Spain under a student visa. International students with a student visa can work up to 4 hours per day on a particular work permit.<\/p>\n<p>This permit is not difficult to get, but students and companies often prefer full-time work. International students may earn up to EUR 20 an hour part-time.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>The UK<\/h3>\n<p>International students at United Kingdom universities who do not hold citizenship for EU or EEA countries can have jobs. Still, there are working limits in Europe to the number of hours they can clock.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Council for International Student Affairs of the UK, international students who hold a Tier 4 (General) visa and are studying at an approved institution can work 20 hours per week during the semester.<\/p>\n<p>The same students can work full time during breaks in the academic year.<\/p>\n<p>EU or EEA students can work in the UK without restriction. Non-EU students with a general student visa can work up to 20 hours per week during term time or full-time during university holidays.<\/p>\n<p>if you want to know more about <a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/work-and-study-abroad\/\">work and study abroad<\/a> read this article:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GHE9ms5Et2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/work-and-study-abroad\/\">What are the Best Countries to Work and Study Abroad?
