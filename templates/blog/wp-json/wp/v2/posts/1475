We start this article with different types of scholarships and how students can benefit from them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Merit-based Scholarships<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The merit-based scholarships or fellowships are based on achievements, talents, affiliations with various groups or career aspirations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The governments, large corporations, organizations, local businesses, or colleges and universities usually offer these scholarships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Like need-based awards, you typically do not have to repay the money. So, the more prestigious awards tend to evaluate skills and qualities. Students should show some abilities to lead, debate, and passion for serving their community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Each fellowship has its eligibility criteria to meet to continue your studies. Let us review some of them:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Scholarships by Universities<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The measures by which universities deliver scholarships are academic excellence, and they are offered under a specific age limit, for example, under 35 years old. In addition, you find out there are special scholarship offers for each level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In Switzerland, for example, you find more scholarships available for a Ph.D. and fewer for a Bachelor&#8217;s or Master&#8217;s degree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The scholarship can cover accommodation costs and health insurance at some international colleges and universities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In Sweden, scholarships cover tuition fees, living expenses, travel fees, and insurance depending on the organization offering them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In France, some scholarship-holders receive a monthly allowance, and the scholarship covers other expenses such as return trips and health insurance. Still, it does not cover tuition fees because they are already deficient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Here are some European universities providing the most significant number of scholarships:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The University of Oxford in the UK,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The University of Bristol in the UK,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The University of Bologna in Italy,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Uppsala University in Sweden,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Utrecht University in the Netherlands.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Scholarships by the Government | Find Scholarships in Europe<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Most government scholarships last for three, six, or nine months, and the scholarship holders are exempt from tuition fees. There are some mandatory criteria to receive this type of scholarship:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Knowledge of a particular language;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Students must be under a specific age limitation;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The given institution requires some educational qualifications.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In the United Kingdom, some of the government scholarships cover the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Tuition fees;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Monthly living allowance;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Return airfare to and from the UK;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Additional grants and allowances to cover expenses.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Sports Scholarships<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">If you want to be a member of the university team, you must be ready for a scholarship, most times offered by the given university. The good news is you do not necessarily have to be very good at sports!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Sometimes local organizations and groups may offer these scholarships, looking at criteria such as community service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Europe highly values football since football competitions at various levels bring excellent income to the continent&#8217;s countries. Football scholarships in Europe are available for bachelors, masters, and keen on football; many football scholarships subsidize the cost of education and promote the student&#8217;s football career.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">These are the top 10 football scholarships in Europe:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Soccer scholarships, National University of Ireland;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Scholarship &#8220;Your Chance,&#8221; MSM International Football Academy;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">BU Sport Scholarship, Bournemouth University;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Sports Scholarships, Newcastle University;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">International Sports Scholarship Program, University of Stirling;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Women&#8217;s Soccer Scholarship, UCLAN;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Sports Scholarship, London South Bank University;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">University Sports Scholarship Scheme, University of Kent;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Brunel University Sports Scholarship, Brunel University;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Sports Scholarships, University of Manchester.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Need-based Scholarships<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Need-based scholarships or grants are financial aid that does not have to be repaid. Compared to merit-based scholarships, grants are primarily need-based.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Grants or bursaries are based on financial circumstances but may also consider other factors, such as mental or physical disabilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">This financial aid does not need to be paid back either, and its value most times vary from $500 to $2500.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The Department of Education offers many grants to students who attend four-year universities, community colleges, and career schools in the US.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In Germany, there are different kinds of merit-based grants. Each institution awarding the merit scholarship determines its exact amount and duration. For example, the University of Hamburg offers students a grant of 720 EUR to 1000 EUR per month for two semesters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Do you want to know about Working Limits in Europe for International Students? read this article:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Xv4VWhU3uk\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/working-limits-in-europe-for-international-students\/\">Working Limits in Europe for International Students<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Working Limits in Europe for International Students&#8221; &#8212; Abroadin \" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/working-limits-in-europe-for-international-students\/embed\/#?secret=eOa6Io9V2o#?secret=Xv4VWhU3uk\" data-secret=\"Xv4VWhU3uk\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Specific Scholarships | Find Scholarships in Europe<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Most specific scholarships are given to international students with a particular ethnic background or family affiliations.
