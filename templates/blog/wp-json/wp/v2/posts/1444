You have the chance to learn other languages, get work experience abroad and prove to future employers that you own the skills and knowledge for succeeding in a globalized world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In this guide:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">What are Different Types of Master&#8217;s Degrees in Europe<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">What to Consider While Study Masters in Europe<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">When and How Grad Programs Start in Europe<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">What are Erasmus Mundus Master&#8217;s Courses<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">What are Different Types of Master&#8217;s Degrees in Europe<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">There are two different types of Master&#8217;s Degrees in Europe; international students who want to study Masters in Europe should know about them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The first one is Master&#8217;s (MSc, MA), a Master&#8217;s program during which you take courses, and your degree culminates with a dissertation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Completion of the degree is based on grades and thesis. To attract more international students, universities try to offer more English Master&#8217;s courses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The second program is a research Master&#8217;s (MPhil); it&#8217;s the same but based entirely on the dissertation. When writing statements about MPhil programs, you really should emphasize what professors you would want to be your advisors. Contacting them before applying would be a big step.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">What to Consider While Study Masters in Europe<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Make sure the program an institution has is what you want to pursue. Suppose you&#8217;re going to be at a university in a specific city or country, but there isn&#8217;t a study program suitable for you or your interests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In that case, it may show in your application, and then the application may become a wasted effort. So always try to think and research about this beforehand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">It&#8217;s also possible your program that sounds good is just too generalized for what you need. Conversely, it might be too specific for your interests at this point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In the same vein, look at the course list and the actual course content, and read up on the professor&#8217;s research interests to understand completely what your program offers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">When researching different programs, try to record your findings in a spreadsheet to track the opportunities you come across. If you&#8217;re stuck, check your network of friends, family members, and professors for contacts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">There are quite a few Master&#8217;s programs taught in English, even outside of England. Particularly at the graduate level, coursework at European universities is usually in English rather than the local languages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The English language is the lingua franca for many international businesses and organizations. To attract more international students, universities offer more English Master&#8217;s courses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">More information about Working Limits in Europe for International Students:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/working-limits-in-europe-for-international-students\/\"><strong><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Working Limits in Europe for International Students<\/span><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">When and How Grad Programs Start in Europe<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">For most of Europe, the Master&#8217;s programs start in September; however, they will begin in October in some cases. The standard European Master&#8217;s program is two years in length, but a few are just one year, full-time, and don&#8217;t allow for opportunities to work on the side.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Some programs are two years part-time, but only for European students. Some students have to apply to the full-time version of the program because they are international students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The final consideration for timing is how the semesters fall. Oxford has three main 8-week semesters with two 6-week &#8220;break terms&#8221; separating them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Some German universities have two semesters, from October-February and March-July. It varies based on different universities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In general, the application process for study Masters in Europe is the same as most other countries. You complete an application, write a statement of motivation, have two letters of reference, and possibly do an extra supplement if your given program requires it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Let&#8217;s get to the study masters in Europe step by step:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">1. Statement of Motivation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The most crucial point of your application is the Statement of Motivation to study in Europe, so you want to make sure you show yourself as professional and determined.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">If you have someone, preferably a professor or mentor, who can check your statement, ask them. They can check for mistakes and give better structure to your writing, even if you&#8217;ve read it a thousand times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">2. Letters of Reference<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Some programs don&#8217;t want letters of reference. However, if letters are not required but send in, doesn&#8217;t your application suddenly become more appealing to the admissions committee and the professors?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Before you take the initiative, be sure to ask. Contact someone at the institution admissions and ask if you can include letters even though they are not required.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1543\" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/arrow-bouncing-off-small-blocks-1.jpg\" alt=\"study masters in europe\" width=\"1232\" height=\"702\" srcset=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/arrow-bouncing-off-small-blocks-1.jpg 1232w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/arrow-bouncing-off-small-blocks-1-300x171.jpg 300w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/arrow-bouncing-off-small-blocks-1-1024x583.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/arrow-bouncing-off-small-blocks-1-768x438.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1232px) 100vw, 1232px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">3. Timelines and Deadlines<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Another point to consider for European Master&#8217;s programs is the deadline, especially if you have to submit papers via post since it&#8217;ll take longer to send necessary documents internationally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Also, keep in mind time region differences for both mail and online applications. There&#8217;s nothing worse than submitting your application only to find out that it&#8217;s late because of the time difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">4. Scholarships and Finances<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The two-year programs usually give you enough time to find work on the side or an internship of some sort with a local business, and your visa lets you do this. However, this isn&#8217;t always an option.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">To prepare, <a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/top-10-masters-scholarships-2023\/\">start looking at scholarships<\/a>, both through your grad school and outside providers when you begin the process of application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">One of the most well-known prospects is the Fulbright grant. To be considered, you have to apply at least a year in advance. For instance, if you want to study Masters in Europe for the fall of 2022, you have to apply by the end of spring 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/scholarships-for-indian-students\/\">Other significant scholarships<\/a> include the Rhodes Scholarship (Oxford), Gates Cambridge (Cambridge), and Mitchell (Ireland), Marshall Scholarship (UK), which fully fund graduate study in their respective destinations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">However, these are very competitive, and they are mostly done through campus scholarship committees at your undergraduate institution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Some countries subsidize their education. For example, Germany has made all public universities free of tuition for all students, including international ones. It means you can attend a university in Germany for two years for only around 5000 EUR per year, plus $7000 to 8000 for living charges, food, and fees that include an all-inclusive transportation pass for the area. You can work on the side to afford them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Plus, a German private university still makes you pay tuition; you can apply for funding from the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service). In this case, grad institute abroad is cheaper than at home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Keep in mind that not all subsidies apply to international students. Denmark and Sweden, for example, subsidize their universities just for their citizens. Still, for international students, tuition is just as expensive as in the US. If the universities and colleges you&#8217;re looking into have two fees listed frequently, the one applicable to you is higher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">However, one perk is that at an institution that offers a one-year program, you&#8217;ll be paying the same tuition fee as you would pay back home, but for one year instead of two. That automatically halves the total price of the given program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1544\" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/visa-application-form-composition-1.jpg\" alt=\"study masters in europe\" width=\"1095\" height=\"730\" srcset=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/visa-application-form-composition-1.jpg 1095w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/visa-application-form-composition-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/visa-application-form-composition-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/visa-application-form-composition-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1095px) 100vw, 1095px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">5. Study Visas<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Some programs, like Erasmus Mundus, help you have a visa turned into a residence permit to travel around Europe while studying. Others require you to have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.schengenvisainfo.com\/student-schengen-visa\/\">regular visa for study<\/a>, but it&#8217;s essential to consider the visa requirements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">If you have plans to stay in Europe and find a job in your home once your studies are finished, you don&#8217;t want to pursue a visa that only gives you a leeway of two weeks to leave the country unless you&#8217;re very specific have a job once you graduate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In the UK, you can study using a Tier 4 Student Visa, which gives you four months of slack time to stay in the country before you have to leave or change your visa type if you find work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">If you study in Dublin, you would have a visa that would allow you to remain in Ireland for 12 months after your studies end. It can vary widely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Visas can also have varying costs. Sometimes it&#8217;s minimal; other times, it may cost $500. It depends on the given country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Do you want to know about <a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/top-business-schools-in-europe-all-you-need-to-know-for-2021\/\">Top Business Schools in Europe<\/a>? you can read this:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"eS1VccofFd\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/top-business-schools-in-europe-all-you-need-to-know-for-2021\/\">Top Business Schools in Europe + All You Need to Know for 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Top Business Schools in Europe + All You Need to Know for 2021&#8221; &#8212; Abroadin \" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/top-business-schools-in-europe-all-you-need-to-know-for-2021\/embed\/#?secret=qusURFqtVS#?secret=eS1VccofFd\" data-secret=\"eS1VccofFd\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">What are Erasmus Mundus Master&#8217;s Courses<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">If you are looking for study Masters in Europe with the opportunity to travel around the continent, the Erasmus Mundus Master&#8217;s Courses (EMMCs) programs are the best choice for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">All in English language and funded by the European Commission, these programs are two years in length and usually include an internship component where you work with a local company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The Erasmus programs are built upon university consortia deals, which means you choose a potential course track or stream for your program. If granted, you would spend one year studying at one university and one year studying in another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Each EMMC has its consortium and group of partner universities, so it&#8217;s best to explore your options. In general, you should get your application in earlier rather than later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">You can only apply to three EMMCs per year, application cycle.
