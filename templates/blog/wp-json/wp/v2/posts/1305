A dependent for visa purposes is:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">A wife, husband, or civil partner,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">A relationship like a marriage, an unmarried partner for at least two years;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">A child under 18 years old.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">If the primary person extends their student visa and has children over 18, they may apply for a further permit to stay as a Dependent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Suppose your wife, husband, civil partner, or unmarried partner applies as a dependent. In that case, the relationship must be honest and exist at the time of application, and you have to intend to live together throughout your stay in your new country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">For children to be qualified for a dependent visa, it is a requirement that both parents need to be in or coming to a European country. There are a few exceptions to this requirement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Families who cannot meet this requirement need to evidence the serious and compelling reasons why the child should be with them in a new country or that you have &#8216;sole responsibility for the child and have made suitable arrangements for the child&#8217;s care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">If your family members are not in a new country or are not eligible to apply for a dependent visa, they could visit you in the country under the standard visitor path. A visitor can generally stay in most European countries for six months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">For more information about Free Universities in Europe for International Students in 2022 read this article:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YVoArJvIV3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/free-universities-in-europe-for-international-students-in-2022\/\">Free Universities in Europe for International Students in 2022<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Free Universities in Europe for International Students in 2022&#8221; &#8212; Abroadin \" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/free-universities-in-europe-for-international-students-in-2022\/embed\/#?secret=F2RYeIP9Cg#?secret=YVoArJvIV3\" data-secret=\"YVoArJvIV3\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Apply for Entry Clearance as a Dependent<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">An application for entry clearance for a visa is made from outside a European country.
