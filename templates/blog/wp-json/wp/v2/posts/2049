It is where education loans step in as a practical solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Education loans in India come in two main categories: those backed by the government and those offered by private institutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Government loans often have lower interest rates; sometimes, the government may even help with the interest. On the other hand, private loans follow a more standard application process but may have slightly higher interest rates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The benefits of education loans are gaining recognition, leading to an increasing number of students and parents opting for them. These loans empower individuals to overcome financial barriers and confidently pursue higher education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Responding to the demand, financial institutions and the government are expanding their offerings, making education loans in India more accessible to a broader audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Let&#8217;s explore all types of education loans for Indian students to provide a comprehensive guide for navigating the landscape of education financing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you wondering<a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/cost-of-studying-abroad-for-indian-students-in-2024\/\"> how much it costs to study abroad in rupees<\/a>, read this\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"NaIdCAib9E\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/cost-of-studying-abroad-for-indian-students-in-2024\/\">Cost of Studying Abroad for Indian Students in 2024<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Cost of Studying Abroad for Indian Students in 2024&#8221; &#8212; Abroadin \" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/cost-of-studying-abroad-for-indian-students-in-2024\/embed\/#?secret=0L3M4v1Toy#?secret=NaIdCAib9E\" data-secret=\"NaIdCAib9E\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Location-Specific Education Loans in India<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">As students pursue their academic journeys, some choose to remain within the country, while others venture abroad for their studies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Depending on the geographical location of your chosen course, you&#8217;ll encounter two distinct types of education loans in India:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Domestic Education Loans in India<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">For those aspiring to study in an Indian institution, domestic education loans come into play. To secure this loan, you must reserve a spot in an institute and meet all the lender&#8217;s eligibility criteria for loan approval.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Overseas Education Loans in India<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Students planning courses outside the country&#8217;s borders are eligible for overseas education loans. To qualify, you must satisfy each eligibility criterion the lender sets, and your application to a foreign institution must be accepted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">After completing your studies, whether you return to India or stay abroad, you can commence repayments as predetermined in the loan documents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2052\" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/happy-young-asian-couple-realtor-agent-1.jpg\" alt=\"education loans in india\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/happy-young-asian-couple-realtor-agent-1.jpg 900w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/happy-young-asian-couple-realtor-agent-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/happy-young-asian-couple-realtor-agent-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Course-Specific Education Loans in India<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Loans for specific courses are readily available from banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and other lenders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">They are course-based education loans and cater to various introductory degree programs and professional courses. Let&#8217;s explore the diverse types of course-based education loans in India:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Undergraduate Education Loans<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Undergraduate education loans are for those completing secondary education and aspiring to pursue an undergraduate degree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">These loans support courses typically spanning three to four years, offering financial assistance for tuition and related expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Completing undergraduate studies opens avenues for multiple job opportunities and serves as a foundation for further academic pursuits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Postgraduate Education Loans<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Many students pursue postgraduate degrees or professional courses instead of or alongside employment after graduation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">For those seeking financial support for postgraduate studies, postgraduate education loans in India are available, regardless of the duration of the chosen course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Education Loans for Career Development<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Lenders extend their offerings to include career development loans, covering professional courses and training programs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">These loans are designed to assist students in enhancing their skills and improving employment prospects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">If you are considering joining career development courses at colleges, technical institutions, or trade schools, you can apply for this loan to support your educational path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Education Loans Based on Collateral Types in India<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Utilizing assets as security to secure a loan is common, and the same applies to funding education in all countries, including India.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Education loans can be obtained by providing collateral, increasing the likelihood of approval due to the secured nature of these loans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Here are the available education loans in the market based on the type of collateral you can offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Loans against Property<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Also known as mortgage loans, these loans allow you to use residential, industrial, or commercial property as collateral.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Whether it&#8217;s a house, flat, or piece of land, you can mortgage it to secure a loan for educational expenses. Most of the time, the property should be under your name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Loans against Securities<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Investments in equity, bonds, and debentures can serve as collateral for education loans. Present your investment portfolio as collateral to a lender and quickly secure a loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Loans against Deposits<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Fixed, recurring, or gold deposits can be used as loan collateral. The interest accumulated in your deposit can be leveraged as security to obtain loans for various purposes, including education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Third-Party Guarantee Loans<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">For those without tangible collateral, third-party guarantees can secure a loan. A person with a good credit score and a history of timely repayments can act as a guarantor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">It means the guarantor takes responsibility for any outstanding debt if the borrower fails to repay the loan on time. The guarantor could be anyone you know, including your parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2051\" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/closeup-real-estate-agent-using-calculator-while-his-client-is-signing-contract-1.jpg\" alt=\"education loans in india\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/closeup-real-estate-agent-using-calculator-while-his-client-is-signing-contract-1.jpg 900w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/closeup-real-estate-agent-using-calculator-while-his-client-is-signing-contract-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/closeup-real-estate-agent-using-calculator-while-his-client-is-signing-contract-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Some Education Loans in India for Students<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">These are some examples of domestic education loans in India:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><strong>Buddy4Study-Propelld Domestic Education Loan Program:<\/strong> <a style=\"color: #333333;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.buddy4study.com\/page\/buddy4study-propelld-domestic-education-loan-programme\">This loan offers up to INR 10 lakh<\/a> for undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled or seeking enrollment in recognized Indian institutions.
