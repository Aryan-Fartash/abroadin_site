However, you may book them in advance to ensure you have the widest choice of temporary housing in the destination country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">If your intended budget is limited, there are many hostels in Canada for short-term accommodation to suit any budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Most hotels and hostels in Canada have a website providing information such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Price,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Location,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Photographs,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">and the services they offer.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">You may also find reviews about them in forums, travel guides, and other websites. Booking self-catering housing, perhaps for a few weeks or even a month or two, is also a practical way to find housing in Canada for your arrival.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Airbnb is the major player in this market, but there are some city-specific temporary apartment rental companies too, which you should be able to identify through a quick web search.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The most common types of accommodation in Canada include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">houses, such as:<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">detached houses with property around them,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">semi-detached and townhouses where each house shares a wall with another,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">condos or condominiums,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">rental apartments, including:<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">apartments with 1 to 3 bedrooms,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">bachelor units made up of a single room as a living area and bedroom,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">rental rooms are usually large homes divided into private rooms you can rent.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Canada&#8217;s national housing agency is called the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

A house divided into two different units is called a duplex, and the ones split in three are known as a triplex. For rent, rooms are available in some houses, with shared living space and bathroom facilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Apartment types for rent in this country vary from bachelor units, where a single room serves as the living area and bedroom, to several bedrooms and separate living areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The cost of utilities, such as water and electricity, may or may not be included in the rent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">You may find apartments and houses for rent in Canada in the classifieds section of local newspapers, libraries, and websites. Facebook groups and Twitter accounts for newcomers to Canada are also helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">You can also walk around your preferred neighborhood in many cities and check for rentals, as property owners post signs outside their property advertising available rooms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1648\" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/crop-people-exchanging-with-keys-1.jpg\" alt=\"find housing in canada\" width=\"1149\" height=\"767\" srcset=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/crop-people-exchanging-with-keys-1.jpg 1149w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/crop-people-exchanging-with-keys-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/crop-people-exchanging-with-keys-1-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/crop-people-exchanging-with-keys-1-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1149px) 100vw, 1149px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Leasing Apartments or Houses in Canada<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Property owners usually request information about your ability to pay rent before offering you a lease in Canada. Requested documents may include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Bank statement providing you have enough savings to cover rent;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Letter from your current or recent employer indicating your annual income;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Reference letter from previous property owners.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Many property owners prefer Canadian documentation, which can be cumbersome or impossible for new arrivals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">There are always property owners who are willing to rent their apartments and houses in Canada to newcomers, so keep trying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">There are some factors to have in mind when looking to find housing in Canada as a newcomer:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Rentals in Canada start on the first of every month, with a smaller number available on the 15th. Plan your trip with this in mind because you want to ensure you have good options. It is advisable to arrive about two weeks before the month&#8217;s end because you get much time to learn about the destination, your surroundings and find suitable apartments or houses for rent.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Most rental apartments and houses in Canada require at least half a month&#8217;s rent as a security deposit.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Rental housing in Canada often comes furnished, so always ask before a viewing. Equipping a place can take time and money, so try Craigslist for cheap stuff.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The best time to get perfect deals on furniture is towards the end of the month as people are moving and often sell their possessions at low prices.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Know your rights as a tenant in Canada. Become familiar with tenancy law in the destination province.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">You can get more information and help from an immigrant-serving organization if you do not have a job, references, or credit history to find housing in Canada after you arrive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">if you want to know Why is Canada the Best Country for Study Abroad read this article:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Xg3nC08O7Q\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/why-is-canada-the-best-country-for-study-abroad\/\">Why is Canada the Best Country for Study Abroad<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why is Canada the Best Country for Study Abroad&#8221; &#8212; Abroadin \" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/why-is-canada-the-best-country-for-study-abroad\/embed\/#?secret=8YSFior0Jd#?secret=Xg3nC08O7Q\" data-secret=\"Xg3nC08O7Q\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Rent Rate to Find Housing for International Students<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Canada is a large country, so it is challenging to answer this question. However, we try to answer how much rent in Canada is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">As of December 2021, Rentseeker.ca, a platform for apartment rents in Canada, shows that the cost of renting in the most popular cities can vary significantly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">For example, an excellent one-bedroom apartment in Edmonton would cost between $700 to $1200 for a month, but the same one-bedroom apartment in Vancouver costs more than $2000 for a month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">You may find that Calgary, Hamilton, and Montreal are between these ranges. At the same time, Ottawa and Toronto are closer to the more expensive end, with Toronto&#8217;s rental market, in particular, has become more expensive over the years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Rentals.ca reveals that Ontario and British Columbia are the top 12 most expensive cities to rent in Canada. Perhaps not surprisingly, Toronto and Vancouver areas top this list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">According to the cost of living comparison, Numbeo.com, one-bedroom downtown apartments in Toronto and Vancouver are now topping $2000 per month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">So you may compromise in some areas; maybe there&#8217;s a more affordable neighborhood outside the city center with good public transportation to find housing in Canada, or maybe you might consider sharing on address with others, at least for starters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1649\" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/female-hand-operating-calculator-front-villa-house-model-1.jpg\" alt=\"find housing in canada\" width=\"1073\" height=\"715\" srcset=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/female-hand-operating-calculator-front-villa-house-model-1.jpg 1073w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/female-hand-operating-calculator-front-villa-house-model-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/female-hand-operating-calculator-front-villa-house-model-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/female-hand-operating-calculator-front-villa-house-model-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1073px) 100vw, 1073px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Payment to Find Housing in Canada<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Unless otherwise agreed, you will likely have signed a lease for a fixed-term, often one year. Once the fixed term elapses, the term may renew for a further year or switch to a month-to-month arrangement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Rules on rent increases vary from province to province. Always discuss with your property owner before signing a lease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In Ontario, rent boosts must occur at least 12 months separated, and residents should receive at least 90 days of notice. The provincial government sets the maximum permitted rent increase. The guideline on rent increases in Ontario is 1.2% for 2022.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Similar rules apply in British Columbia, where the maximum permitted rent increase for 2022 in BC is 1.5%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Rents in Alberta may also only be raised if more than one year since the previous increase. However, there is no cap on the boost like Ontario and British Columbia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In summary, you usually have to pay the rent to the superintendent, property manager, or property owner on each month&#8217;s first day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">You may pay your intended rent in cash or by a post-dated check. Many property owners ask for 12 checks dated the first day of each month for the next 12 months. You may also pay by certified checks, guaranteed by a bank. Many property owners ask for a certified check for the first and last month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Make sure you ask your property owner for a receipt and keep its proof of payment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In some places, your rent may include some or all of your utilities, such as heat, water and Electricity. If they are not provided in your rent, you must pay these bills yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">if you want to know Challenges of International Students in Canada read this article:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"StnPw7X7Y6\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/5-challenges-of-international-students-in-canada\/\">5 Challenges of International Students in Canada<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;5 Challenges of International Students in Canada&#8221; &#8212; Abroadin \" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/5-challenges-of-international-students-in-canada\/embed\/#?secret=HCyrt0pjUN#?secret=StnPw7X7Y6\" data-secret=\"StnPw7X7Y6\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Most Affordable Places in Canada<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Montreal is the most affordable big city to find housing in Canada to rent.
