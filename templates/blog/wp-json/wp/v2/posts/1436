In that case, you are eligible for a temporary short time visa for up to six months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">You might consider the various options available during this period due to your educational qualifications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Remember that this is not a long-term visa or a work permit. It only helps you in your search for a permanent position. You need to apply for this visa in your home country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">You should apply for a separate residence and work permit after being employed for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">To be eligible for this visa option, you must meet the following criteria:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Secure financial means,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Academic or vocational qualification,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Proof of German language competence.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Temporary Residence Permit for Taking up Employment<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">When you get a job offer that matches your qualifications, you can decide whether you wish to apply for a German residency permit to start working or an EU Blue Card to continue your stay in Germany after studies and graduation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">German Residence Permit allows internationals to work in Germany for a specific time, as indicated by their employment contract. If your contract is limited to two years, your approval will be valid for two years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">You can extend the permit if your employment status remains the same.
