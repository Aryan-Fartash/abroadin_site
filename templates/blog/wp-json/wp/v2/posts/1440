Let&#8217;s get to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In this guide:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">How do Indian Students Go to Canada During the Pandemic?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Canada Visa Requirements for Indians<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">5 Important Things About Visa Requirements for Indians<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Travel Restrictions and Covid-19 Pandemic<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">How do Indian Students Go to Canada During the Pandemic?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">It&#8217;s a complicated journey for Indian students heading to colleges in Canada, which costs much more than they usually think.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Flying to Canada has become more protracted and more expensive due to the extension of the ban on direct flights from India.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Ottawa recognizes Covishield, the Covid-19 vaccine taken by most Indians, but they must do the compulsory Corona Virus test before arriving in Canada in a third country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Issuing a visa takes more time due to rising travel demand, say, education consultants, helping more than a thousand students get admission in Canadian universities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The HCC (High Commission of Canada) in New Delhi acknowledged the negative effect of the pandemic on the processing time for study permits. The high commission says in this regard:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">&#8220;For study permit still in process, we cannot guarantee that students will receive a decision on their application or be able to go to Canada before the semester begins.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">This process cannot be expedited given the high volumes of passports we are currently receiving each week.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">However, experts say it is not dampening the Indian students&#8217; interest in Canada for higher education. One of the main attractions is perpetual residency offered to Indian students after getting some work experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Canada is a dreamy educational destination for thousands of international students; however, there are several hurdles they need to clear before they travel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">An essential one is the Canadian Student visa. Currently, Indian students traveling to Canada have to take third-country routes, which causes more expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Before applying for a Canadian visa, students should do some research. Here are a few essential points students should have before they apply for their visa:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Canada Visa Requirements for Indians<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Lockdown due to Covid-19 and travel restrictions have contributed to a considerable delay in visa processing for specific countries, which has disrupted students&#8217; travel plans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Universities and consultants recommend that students who have received their Canadian student permits either usually or via SDS shouldn&#8217;t delay applying for their permits and visas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here are common reasons for student visa rejection in the link below:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/student-visa-rejection-22-common-reasons\/\"><strong>Common Reasons for Student&#8217;s Visa Rejection<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">University Acceptance Letter<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The acceptance letter is a must-have requirement for the visa process. So the first step of the visa application process is to shortlist the top universities that suit a person&#8217;s profile and scores.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">It&#8217;s important to shortlist at least three different universities with several backup options.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Tip: You can categorize universities into three categories, including Dream, Reach, and Safe. This method helps students sort through options and makes it easy to decide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">However, before you apply to a Canadian university, make sure it is a DLI (Designated Learning Institution).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Student Permit; Visa Requirements for Indians<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">This document is issued to international students who want to study at Designated Learning Institutions in Canada.
