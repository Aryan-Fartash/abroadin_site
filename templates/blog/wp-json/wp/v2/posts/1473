If you plan to study in Canadian colleges, first you should know the differences between these institutions and universities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The words &#8220;university&#8221; and &#8220;college&#8221; have different meanings in various English-speaking countries.

Many also offer Bachelor&#8217;s degrees in applied areas of study.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">These higher education institutions are more career-oriented than universities. It means they offer practical or hands-on training. Generally, a certificate program is one year or less, and a diploma is 2 or 3 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Colleges offer pre-trades and apprenticeship training, language training, and skills upgrading too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">What are Universities in Canada?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Universities are institutions that can grant degrees. All universities have undergraduate degrees, and many have graduate programs. Most Canadian universities are independent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Although they receive funding from the government, each institution is self-governing and regulates its programs, admissions, and faculty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Undergraduate degrees usually take 3 to 4 years to complete if you study full-time. If you plan to continue a graduate program, an Honors Degree is required. Many universities allow students to merge subject areas into a Double Major.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Many universities offer professional programs, such as Law, medicine, and dentistry too. Sometimes, you can begin these programs after finishing 2 or 3 years of undergraduate study.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1584\" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/young-student-learning-library-1.jpg\" alt=\"colleges in Canada\" width=\"1185\" height=\"792\" srcset=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/young-student-learning-library-1.jpg 1185w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/young-student-learning-library-1-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/young-student-learning-library-1-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/young-student-learning-library-1-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1185px) 100vw, 1185px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">All Differences between American Colleges and Canadian Colleges<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Knowing the differences between college and university in Canada, let us see differences between Canadian colleges and American ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">From government structure to educational system, there are some essential differences between the US and Canada.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">If you are considering attending colleges in Canada or the United States, you should know some factors from the cost of tuition to the campus experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The following are ten ways colleges differ in the US and Canada based on a paper by Joel Westheimer, a full professor at the University of Ottawa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In Canada, what Americans Call College is Called University<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Colleges in Canada are called universities; however, smaller educational institutions in Canada are called colleges that grant certificates and diplomas instead of typical degrees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In the US, whether you attend a college or a university, it&#8217;s usually referred to as college.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">American Colleges Cost more than Canadian Ones<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The average tuition in Canada is $6653. It is $35676 for a private university in the US.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">A college education usually costs less in Canada. It is just one reason why a growing number of international students opt to attend school in this country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The US&#8217;s average cost of private tuition for the 2018-2019 academic year was $35676, with public, in-state tuition averaging $9716. The average tuition for Canadian students varies from $6653 to $2172.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">One of the significant cultural differences between the US and Canada is that Canadians view education as a typical right than a privilege.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Admission to Canadian Universities is based Mostly on GPA<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Standardized exams are part of the application process in American universities, but admission to Canadian universities is a little easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Outside of Quebec, where students must complete a Diploma of Collegial Studies, Canadians need a secondary-school diploma to apply for undergraduate programs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Universities and colleges accept applicants with a GPA of 70% or higher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The Canadian Application Process is not as Competitive<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Without the pressure to outdo regulated testing, Westheimer said the application process is more relaxed in Canada than in the US.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Moreover, students apply to universities independently rather than with a universal applying tool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In the US, there is a Bigger Emphasis on the Dorm Experience<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Unlike in the US, where four-year colleges make it obligatory for students to live on campus for at least part of their education, Canada&#8217;s residential experience is rarer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">It is more common for Canadian Students to go to a University Close to Home<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In the United States, people apply to colleges throughout their area and even across the country; however, that is not true in Canada, where it is more typical for students to live at home and commute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">According to a 2012 survey in Canada, only 10% of students leave their area for university.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Class Year is not as important in Canada.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">While American college students often enjoy their graduating-class year, graduating is not as big a deal in Canada.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Most Canadian universities offer three or four-year education, but there is less emphasis on how long it takes you to finish your courses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">School Years Have Different Names in Both Countries<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Rather than calling school years sophomore or Junior, as they do in the United States, Canadians usually say Second Year, Third Year, and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Most Canadian Universities tend to be Bigger than Universities in the US<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">For example, the University of Toronto has more than 90000 students, including over 55000 undergrads. That is an even bigger student society than at the most prominent US state school, the University of Central Florida, where about 66000 students are enrolled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">There are More Experimental Colleges in the US<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The United States has a larger community than Canada, 327 million people compared to 37 million, so there is more versatility for experimental education models.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">For more information about challenges in Canada read this article:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"46rPvkdqLT\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/5-challenges-of-international-students-in-canada\/\">5 Challenges of International Students in Canada<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;5 Challenges of International Students in Canada&#8221; &#8212; Abroadin \" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/5-challenges-of-international-students-in-canada\/embed\/#?secret=NpjuoQVc0Q#?secret=46rPvkdqLT\" data-secret=\"46rPvkdqLT\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Some of the Best Colleges in Canada<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Every year, many students look to harness the benefits that come with the experience of studying abroad.
