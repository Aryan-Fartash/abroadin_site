Graduation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Now let us look at some options to change your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.internationalstudent.com\/immigration\/f1-student-visa\/\">F-1 visa<\/a> to a Green Card to help you decide which path fits you best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">What is an F-1 Visa?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The F-1 visa is for international students in the United States for higher education or attending the English Language Program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">They are usually may remain in the country until they have completed their full-time academic courses of study at approved educational institutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Technically, the F-1 visa is for applicants who intend to return to their home country upon completing their studies unless they participate in the post-completion OPT (optional practical training).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">This program allows international students to participate in their central study area for one year following graduation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">International students with degrees in particular STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) may be eligible for a 24-month extension of their post-completion OPT authorization to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">However, the F-1 visa holder is still expected to return to their home country after the degree, OPT, or STEM OPT program is completed, unless they become a permanent resident of the US.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">F-1 visa to EB-1 Visa | Green Card after Graduation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">One option for students in the United States on F-1 visas and who wish to become Green Card holders is to get an EB-1 visa, also known as first-preference employment-based US visas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">This visa is for international students and foreign nationals with extraordinary abilities, including the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Recipients of an Olympic medal, Oscar, or Pulitzer Prize<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Outstanding researchers or professors<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Multinational managers and executives<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Unique abilities in the arts, business, or sciences fields,<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">For applicants based on extraordinary abilities, they must also meet at least three out of 10 of the following criteria:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Receipt of nationally or internationally respectful prizes or awards for excellence;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Membership in associations in the field demand outstanding achievement of their members;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Published works about the applicant in professional or major trade publications;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Evidence of having been asked to judge the work of others, either individually or on a panel;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Original artistic, athletic, or business-related scientific, scholarly contributions of major significance to the field;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Authorship of scholarly papers in professional or major trade publications;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Work displayed at artistic displays;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Performance of a leading or vital role in distinguished organizations;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">A high salary or other relatively high remuneration concerning others in the field;<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Commercial successes in the performing arts.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Because many F-1 visa holders usually find it hard to meet the criteria to apply for an EB-1 visa, this option is not often a path to a Green Card.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">If you want to apply for an EB-1 visa, you can either find a sponsoring employer in your area of specialty or petition for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">If you are petitioning through a sponsoring employer, the employer is typically required to pay for your petition and follow the applicable visa and labor laws.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">For self-petitioners, you are required to file Form I-140, Petition for Alien Worker, and pay the fees yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Because EB-1 visas are typically only for people with exceptional abilities, have contributed significant research, or have multinational positions in companies, it is not easy to be approved unless you meet the requirements indicated above.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1530\"
