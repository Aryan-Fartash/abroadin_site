<p>Here is step-by-step guidance on health insurance and the cost of student insurance in Canada for international students:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Firstly Check Cost of Student Insurance</span></h3>
<p>After registering for the course, log into your SSC (Student Services Centre) and select “Financial Summary” under Finances to check the cost of student insurance and related charges. Confirm charging for iMED coverage and AMS/GSS Health and Dental Plan charges. If you are charged, then you are covered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Secondly, Confirm iMED Coverage Dates.</span></h3>
<p>If you started the course between September 2021 and August 2022, you have to confirm the exact arriving time to be covered, starting from 3 weeks before arriving time. If you start your studies in September 2022 or after that, you should change your coverage dates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Then Download and Print iMED Card.</span></h3>
<p>They send your iMED card through email. When you receive the email, download the card and print it correctly to present it when arriving in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Apply for the University MSP</span></h3>
<p>As soon as arriving at your university, apply for MSP (Medical Services Plan)</p>
<p>for yourself and family members who accompany you.</p>
<p>Each time you prolong your study permit or receive a post-graduation Work Permit, you must extend your MSP to secure insurance coverage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Download and Print AMS/GSS Health and Dental Plan Pay Direct Card</span></h3>
<p>Your Pay Direct card provides your claim to be prepared when you fill a prescription. You may charge a lower cost of student insurance if you use this plan when you study in Canadian universities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">What is iMED Program + Cost of Student Insurance</span></h2>
<p>The iMED is temporary private health insurance to cover international students while waiting to be eligible for the MSP. The Medical Services Plan has a three-month waiting period, so students have to get coverage during this time.</p>
<p>The time covers the following needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doctor visits,</li>
<li>Hospital visits,</li>
<li>Maternity coverage,</li>
<li>Ambulance services,</li>
<li>Pre-existing conditions,</li>
<li>Diagnostic, x-ray, and laboratory services.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are an exchange student for one semester or a VIRS student, you will have iMED for the duration of your <a href="https://abroadin.com/blog/short-term-study-abroad-programs-in-canada/">education in Canada.</a></p>
<p>If you have MSP or another Canadian territorial or provincial health plan or a third-party organization is funding your courses, you could qualify to opt out of iMED.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">The iMED Coverage Period</span></h2>
<p>After registering for the course, if the program started between September 2021 and August 2022, you would have received an email from DCIS (David Cummings Insurance Services) requesting confirmation of your arrival in Canada.</p>
<p>You have to confirm when you will travel with DCIS starting from 3 weeks before arriving in Canada so that your coverage time starts as soon as you arrive in Canada.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your program starts in 2022/22 winter semester (September to December 2022), your coverage begins on August 1, 2022;</li>
<li>If your program starts in 2022/23 winter semester (January to April 2023), your coverage begins on December 1, 2022;</li>
<li>If you are an exchange student for one semester or a VIRS student, you have the iMED coverage for the duration of your course;</li>
<li>If you arrive the month before or after your coverage starts, you can request to change coverage dates.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Cost of Student Insurance and iMED Fees</span></h2>
<p>Effective 2021/22 winter semester, September 1, 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>About $225 for three months,</li>
<li>About $315 for one-term exchange students.</li>
</ul>
<p>Effective 2022 summer semester, May 1, 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>About $10 for a one-time direct billing fee.</li>
</ul>
<p>These fees are charged to the SSC (Student Service Centre) account. Remember that the fees and cost of student insurance are subject to change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Eligibility for Health Insurance in Canada</span></h2>
<p>You are automatically registered in iMED as a new international university student when you enroll in classes. In your Student Services Centre account, check the Financial Summary page to make sure you were charged the fee and will be registered in the course.</p>
<p>If you are a returning university student, you are not qualified for iMED and can purchase private insurance, such as the GCHP (Global Campus Health Plan).</p>
<p>If you think you should have coverage for iMED but do not see the fees on your account, contact ISA (International Student Advising).</p>
<ul>
<li>If your program started between September 2021 and August 2022, you would have received an email from DCIS requesting approval of your arrival to Canada after you registered for classes. You must confirm your arrival date starting three weeks before you move. After verifying your arrival date, they send your iMED card through email. Make sure to print a copy for yourself.</li>
<li>If your program begins September 2021 or later, they send you an iMED card via email. Make sure to print a copy of it for yourself.</li>
<li>If you do not get your card, contact David Cummings Insurance Services.</li>
<li>Verify that the iMED coverage time on your iMED card is correct. iMED coverage should begin from the month you move to Canada plus two months to cover the MSP waiting period or cover the whole duration of your studies program if you are a one-term exchange student or VIRS student.</li>
<li>If you have any family members accompanying you, you have to add them to iMED too.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>The approximate cost of student insurance in Canada starting from September 2021 is around $265 for one year, and starting from January 2022 is around: $177 for eight months. If the international students have any accompanying family members, they are also responsible for adding them to the plan. Read this article for more information.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #333333;">Find Housing in Canada is one of the first things any international student wants to tick off their To-Do list. Depending on your case, you may desire to find temporary housing in Canada first while looking for apartments or houses for rent. This article advises finding housing in Canada before arriving on your first night and beyond. Let us get to them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In this guide:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Temporary Housing in Canada</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Find Housing in Canada for Rent</span></li>

<li><span style="color: #333333;">Conclusion</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Temporary Housing in Canada</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Before you arrive, it is essential to find housing in Canada or at least somewhere for your first few nights.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Hotels and hostels are plentiful in urban areas. However, you may book them in advance to ensure you have the widest choice of temporary housing in the destination country.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If your intended budget is limited, there are many hostels in Canada for short-term accommodation to suit any budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Most hotels and hostels in Canada have a website providing information such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Price,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Location,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Photographs,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">and the services they offer.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You may also find reviews about them in forums, travel guides, and other websites. Booking self-catering housing, perhaps for a few weeks or even a month or two, is also a practical way to find housing in Canada for your arrival.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Airbnb is the major player in this market, but there are some city-specific temporary apartment rental companies too, which you should be able to identify through a quick web search.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The most common types of accommodation in Canada include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">houses, such as:</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">detached houses with property around them,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">semi-detached and townhouses where each house shares a wall with another,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">condos or condominiums,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">rental apartments, including:</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">apartments with 1 to 3 bedrooms,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">bachelor units made up of a single room as a living area and bedroom,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">rental rooms are usually large homes divided into private rooms you can rent.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Canada&#8217;s national housing agency is called the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Their Housing for Newcomers section has helpful information about renting and buying a house.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Find Housing in Canada for Rent</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">There are several types of rental housing in Canada, including condominiums, apartments, and houses.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Some houses are rentable, while some are divided into several different units. A house divided into two different units is called a duplex, and the ones split in three are known as a triplex. For rent, rooms are available in some houses, with shared living space and bathroom facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Apartment types for rent in this country vary from bachelor units, where a single room serves as the living area and bedroom, to several bedrooms and separate living areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The cost of utilities, such as water and electricity, may or may not be included in the rent.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You may find apartments and houses for rent in Canada in the classifieds section of local newspapers, libraries, and websites. Facebook groups and Twitter accounts for newcomers to Canada are also helpful.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You can also walk around your preferred neighborhood in many cities and check for rentals, as property owners post signs outside their property advertising available rooms.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Leasing Apartments or Houses in Canada</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Property owners usually request information about your ability to pay rent before offering you a lease in Canada. Requested documents may include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Bank statement providing you have enough savings to cover rent;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Letter from your current or recent employer indicating your annual income;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Reference letter from previous property owners.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Many property owners prefer Canadian documentation, which can be cumbersome or impossible for new arrivals.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">There are always property owners who are willing to rent their apartments and houses in Canada to newcomers, so keep trying.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">There are some factors to have in mind when looking to find housing in Canada as a newcomer:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Rentals in Canada start on the first of every month, with a smaller number available on the 15th. Plan your trip with this in mind because you want to ensure you have good options. It is advisable to arrive about two weeks before the month&#8217;s end because you get much time to learn about the destination, your surroundings and find suitable apartments or houses for rent.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Most rental apartments and houses in Canada require at least half a month&#8217;s rent as a security deposit.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Rental housing in Canada often comes furnished, so always ask before a viewing. Equipping a place can take time and money, so try Craigslist for cheap stuff.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">The best time to get perfect deals on furniture is towards the end of the month as people are moving and often sell their possessions at low prices.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Know your rights as a tenant in Canada. Become familiar with tenancy law in the destination province.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You can get more information and help from an immigrant-serving organization if you do not have a job, references, or credit history to find housing in Canada after you arrive.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Rent Rate to Find Housing for International Students</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Canada is a large country, so it is challenging to answer this question. However, we try to answer how much rent in Canada is.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">As of December 2021, Rentseeker.ca, a platform for apartment rents in Canada, shows that the cost of renting in the most popular cities can vary significantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">For example, an excellent one-bedroom apartment in Edmonton would cost between $700 to $1200 for a month, but the same one-bedroom apartment in Vancouver costs more than $2000 for a month.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You may find that Calgary, Hamilton, and Montreal are between these ranges. At the same time, Ottawa and Toronto are closer to the more expensive end, with Toronto&#8217;s rental market, in particular, has become more expensive over the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Rentals.ca reveals that Ontario and British Columbia are the top 12 most expensive cities to rent in Canada. Perhaps not surprisingly, Toronto and Vancouver areas top this list.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">According to the cost of living comparison, Numbeo.com, one-bedroom downtown apartments in Toronto and Vancouver are now topping $2000 per month.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So you may compromise in some areas; maybe there&#8217;s a more affordable neighborhood outside the city center with good public transportation to find housing in Canada, or maybe you might consider sharing on address with others, at least for starters.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1649" src="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/female-hand-operating-calculator-front-villa-house-model-1.jpg" alt="find housing in canada" width="1073" height="715" srcset="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/female-hand-operating-calculator-front-villa-house-model-1.jpg 1073w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/female-hand-operating-calculator-front-villa-house-model-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/female-hand-operating-calculator-front-villa-house-model-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/female-hand-operating-calculator-front-villa-house-model-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1073px) 100vw, 1073px" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Payment to Find Housing in Canada</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Unless otherwise agreed, you will likely have signed a lease for a fixed-term, often one year. Once the fixed term elapses, the term may renew for a further year or switch to a month-to-month arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Rules on rent increases vary from province to province. Always discuss with your property owner before signing a lease.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In Ontario, rent boosts must occur at least 12 months separated, and residents should receive at least 90 days of notice. The provincial government sets the maximum permitted rent increase. The guideline on rent increases in Ontario is 1.2% for 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Similar rules apply in British Columbia, where the maximum permitted rent increase for 2022 in BC is 1.5%.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Rents in Alberta may also only be raised if more than one year since the previous increase. However, there is no cap on the boost like Ontario and British Columbia.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In summary, you usually have to pay the rent to the superintendent, property manager, or property owner on each month&#8217;s first day.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You may pay your intended rent in cash or by a post-dated check. Many property owners ask for 12 checks dated the first day of each month for the next 12 months. You may also pay by certified checks, guaranteed by a bank. Many property owners ask for a certified check for the first and last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Make sure you ask your property owner for a receipt and keep its proof of payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In some places, your rent may include some or all of your utilities, such as heat, water and Electricity. If they are not provided in your rent, you must pay these bills yourself.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Most Affordable Places in Canada</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Montreal is the most affordable big city to find housing in Canada to rent. The average price of a month&#8217;s rent in Canada&#8217;s second-largest city is still under $1000, and much less if you share accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Montreal compares favorably with other large Canadian cities. Other cities in Quebec, such as Quebec City and Gatineau, are even more affordable for renters.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Their data also clarifies that while Ontario is home to Canada&#8217;s most expensive cities for renting, it&#8217;s also central to some of the most affordable. Newcomers seeking more affordable rentals should look towards smaller cities in Quebec and Ontario.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Some recent data clarifies that while Ontario is home to Canada&#8217;s most expensive cities for renting, as outlined above, it&#8217;s also home to some of the cheapest. Sault Ste. Marie, Timmins, and Cornwall have suitable accommodation for rent at a fraction of the cost you&#8217;d find in Toronto.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">International students and newcomers to Canada looking for more affordable rentals may look towards smaller cities in Ontario and Quebec.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you are a university student planning to go to Canada, it is essential to find housing in Canada before arriving in the country, especially for the first days. Many hotels and hostels are in urban areas, but some people prefer to rent apartments or houses. This article provides essential information about finding rental places, how to lease, and the payments for different accommodations.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Academic Challenges International Students Have</span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">With much else going on in your path, it can be simple to concentrate on everything but your classes and homework, but remember that your academic experience is what brought you to this country.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">While your course and studies should always come first, this can be a challenge if you discover that the English language and classroom expectations differ from your home country.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">The learning style in the US differs, and you realize that once you come to study there. You also come across various international learning techniques.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">For example, in some Asian countries, students are familiar with lecture-based classes. However, you must do more practical work in the US, like attending workshops and seminars.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">We suggest you focus on your studies, embrace your new culture, and follow these solutions to have a satisfactory educational experience.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Solutions for Academic Challenges</span></h3>
<span style="color: #333333;">Talk to your professor. While talking to professors who lecture in front of hundreds of students can be discouraging, their job is to teach. Try to take advantage of office hours if you cannot stay after class.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Ask your university&#8217;s guidance counselor for a student mentor&#8217;s email address and connect with them to discuss your problems.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">If you are not clear on a task, talk to your professor, their assistant, or another international or local student.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">In the US, study groups are typical. Joining a group for your difficult classes can help you learn better, unite with others, and allow you to receive extra help clarifying coursework.</span>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Cultural Challenges Students Face in the US</span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">When you arrive in the US, you immerse yourself in a different culture from your own culture at home.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">The intense feelings of irritability you may experience in a new country can feel overwhelming. It is called Culture Shock.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Culture shock is one of the significant impacts of moving from a familiar culture to another unfamiliar one. It retains the shock of a new environment, meeting many new people, and learning the new country&#8217;s ways.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">American customs at restaurants, class and everyday life can feel strange if you are used to other cultures.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">In Japan, for example, it is common to bow when meeting someone new, but this would be highly irregular in the US.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">In Spain, people may bump into each other in busy areas, but in the United States, they value personal space, privacy and do not wish to be touched in any way.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">To get up to speed on everything from tipping in a coffee shop to communication, check out the following tips for overpowering US cultural barriers.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Solutions for Cultural Challenges</span></h3>
<span style="color: #333333;">Prepare for culture shock and try to understand common remedies for it. Understand and accept that you are a different person studying abroad.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Teacher-student relationships are relatively informal in the US, particularly in the Asian education system. Get an understanding of how you should interact.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Make new friends as soon as you arrive. Also, look to your fellow international students as a support network and a place to share and learn about standard practices in the United States.</span>

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1502" src="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/one-hundred-american-dollars-closeup-paper-money-cash-1.jpg" alt="challenges international students" width="1095" height="730" srcset="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/one-hundred-american-dollars-closeup-paper-money-cash-1.jpg 1095w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/one-hundred-american-dollars-closeup-paper-money-cash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/one-hundred-american-dollars-closeup-paper-money-cash-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/one-hundred-american-dollars-closeup-paper-money-cash-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1095px) 100vw, 1095px" />
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Financial Challenges International Students Face</span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">Attending American colleges or universities is expensive. Tuition at a public university costs a lot, and private ones cost even more.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">According to given data, a moderate budget for a private college is about $48000 per year. With that kind of expense, it is essential to figure out how to pay for tuition, studying, and living expenses before you arrive.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">An additional financial challenge many international students do not expect is the cost of health insurance. There is no automatic healthcare for Americans, so make sure you get good insurance through your college or university.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">If your institution does not offer a health plan, look into international student health insurance to make sure you do not end up with hefty medical bills in addition to your education, room, and board costs.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Solutions for Financial Challenges</span></h3>
<span style="color: #333333;">There is a scholarship for almost every topic of study and minority group. Other scholarships are merit-based, meaning based on high achievement and extracurricular activity, or need-based.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Some are available for US citizens only, but many are available for anyone. You cannot get the scholarship unless you apply, so talk to your school&#8217;s financial aid office for scholarships specific to your school.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Apply for other financial aid, including student loans and grants or fellowships. While most student loans in the US are only available to American citizens, your university&#8217;s financial support office may have extra options for international students.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Some on-campus jobs for students include opportunities in the school cafeteria, bookstore, library, or gymnasium.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">While it is unlikely you will earn enough to pay most of your expenses, a part-time job can help with course books, clothing, and personal expenses. Be sure to note US working regulations for international students.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Homesickness Challenge in the US</span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">It is another big challenge for almost every international student. After all, it&#8217;s hard being thousands of miles away from family and friends.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">No matter how enthusiastic you were before leaving your home country to study in the United States, you miss home, and that is for sure.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">You will miss home food, your family and siblings, your friends, but you have to adapt to the new circumstances and make a habit of living without all you left at home.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Solutions for Homesickness</span></h3>
<span style="color: #333333;">You have to oppose homesickness and do what you are assumed to do there in the US, and that is to study harder and make your future path. New people, the new environment may haunt you at your arrival, and you may feel alone, but you have to keep going on.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">To overcome this, view your time in the US as both an adventure and an opportunity. Homesickness often lasts several months; however, you can frequently speak with your family and loved ones thanks to online, face-to-face apps.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Social Challenges International Students Have</span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">Students and teachers interact differently in the US, which is one of the challenges international students face in the US; however, people interact differently in social situations.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Starting as a new student in a program abroad can feel lonely and intimidating, so come out of your comfort zone. It is suggested to know many people while you are acquainted with your new home, neighborhood, and college for the duration of your studies.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">It is not necessary to come across people who socially abuse you. However, it helps if you always were prepared for the worst. Most of the abuses have been identified due to cultural differences and race.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">It would be best to be prepared beforehand to avoid last-minute panic attacks. International students have a common challenge, and you must not take it too seriously.</span>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Solutions for Social Challenges</span></h3>
<span style="color: #333333;">Get to know other international students in your program who are going through the same social changes. Try to attend meetings, outings and sign up for weekend trips or excursions.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">An excellent place to start is participating in student groups on campus, volunteering, and academic groups. Your college or university should have a listing of all active groups available.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Befriend local students, as they can help you be acquainted with the school and introduce you to new friends. Try to sit next to them in the classroom and offer to collaborate with them on projects.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">We have discussed the significant challenges international students face when they stay in the United States; however, it will help them greatly.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Know how to make yourself relaxed with the new setting and adapt accordingly. Moving to a new place makes room for many discomforts. However, you do not have to be concerned because, with time, you get used to the new environment.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">You should know that it is only a matter of time, and then you will start enjoying your new life in the United States.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Nevertheless, keep the above points in mind to have at least some idea about all that could happen to you. Just go well prepared and make the most of the excellent education you will receive in your new university.</span>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">Many international students come to the US for higher education and have mental health challenges, social adjustment, and other issues. According to a report by WES (World Education Services), almost 40 percent of students say living away from their home country, cultural and language barriers as the factors that were more challenging than expected. This article covers most of these challenges international students face and provide you with some proven solutions.</span>						</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many international students, studying abroad is their first time living away from home. On top of managing university workload in another country, they have to learn to manage other aspects of life. Students who can cope with these challenges are more successful toward their path to the future. In this article, we discuss five challenges of international students in Canada. Keep reading to learn more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>1.Challenges of International Students in Canada: Taking Control of Finances</strong></h2>
<p>Money can disappear quickly with food, rent, and other living costs. Moreover, most of the planning is done before going to Canada, so many times, international students look for help when they are already coping with challenges.</p>
<p>If an international student is having difficulties managing finances, it&#8217;s better to talk to a counselor about finances early on budget. Financial counseling is offered to students at many post-secondary institutions in Canada.</p>
<p>When setting up a bank account, students can also seek financial advice from their financial institution. There&#8217;re also online tools available on the Internet that can help students with budgeting.</p>
<p>Another aspect of financial problems for international students in Canada is the difference between currencies. Before packing your bags and jumping on an airplane, you should make sure that you are familiar with the exchange rate.</p>
<p>You can use a currency converter, such as the one Google offers in the results. Write down the intended amount, choose your local currency from the dropdown menu, and select Canada&#8217;s currency.</p>
<p>There are also other monetary differences to have in mind. For example, while some countries include taxes in an item&#8217;s price, international students should be aware that taxes are not included in Canada. It means taxes must be calculated in addition to the price tag on the product.</p>

<h2><strong>2.Working in Canada as an International Student</strong></h2>
<p>According to the Canadian Bureau of International Education&#8217;s study, 51% of international students plan to apply for permanent residence in Canada after graduation. Research suggests many international students who want to stay in this country feel the labor market is challenging to access. Researchers note that many students interviewed expressed fear of not finding jobs in their field of study.</p>
<p>Finding a job for international students can be complicated even though Canada is famous for being rich in jobs. It&#8217;s a factor that has made it receive lots of immigrants every year. However, students can still find jobs though they are low paying. Securing a job is essential since it will help international students to pay for accommodation, transportation, Internet, food, and other basics. The course that a student seeks determines a lot whether acquiring a job will be easy or hard.</p>
<p>Most companies and individual employees are sometimes doubtful about hiring international students due to local laws. A good strategy that can help you reduce employment problems is getting familiarized with the Canadian labor market before searching for a job.</p>
<p>Generally, students have a very bleak outlook on their job prospects post-graduation. They describe their situation as being evil because of the state of the Canadian economy. They recognize that the job market is challenging for Canadian students too.</p>
<p>Still, They believe that it is one of the most demanding challenges of international students in this country. To help increase views, students may want to investigate getting a co-op situation through school to build up their Canadian work experience.</p>
<p>Additionally, networking through family connections, social contacts from events and clubs, and previous coworkers may help your job search.</p>
<p>Generally, international students face more obstacles than domestic students when receiving a degree in Canada. Take the first move, and take advantage of arrangements to help set you up to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>Moreover, attending in the community, volunteering, and networking make yourself an essential part of the community, and you&#8217;ll be bound to succeed.</p>
<p>According to the Canadian government website, international students in Canada with student visas could get a part-time job while studying in this country.</p>
<p>If you study full-time in a qualifying university or institution in Canada, you could work on-campus without a work permit, but that&#8217;s not all.</p>
<p>Additionally, suppose you have professional or vocational education. You could also work part-time outside of the campus while studying and full-time in breaks, up to 20 hours per week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3.Challenges of International Students in Canada: Culture Shock</strong></h2>
<p>Coping up with a different culture can be very hard, especially when you are new to the environment. It is primarily determined by where you come from. This difference in culture can be followed by other side effects that can, somehow, affect your performance.</p>
<p>The best thing that an international student can do to help adjust to the environment is socializing with the local people as much as possible and always being open to asking questions. It can help when you have someone you know in the institution such that you spend time reading together and talking about different subjects.</p>
<p>The good thing is that Canada is varied in culture and religion such that a student can find a culture that corresponds to their interests.</p>
<p>You probably aren&#8217;t conscious about the unwritten rules at home, those day-to-day things you do which may be unfamiliar to foreigners. One example is a simple handshake.</p>
<p>A firm handshake is standard practice in one country, but it may be considered offensive in another country. As with everything else, observe the local people and engage in their culture. You will ultimately adjust and can even teach your new friends about your culture.</p>
<p>One of the most common challenges of international students is the language barrier. You may have spent the last four years studying the language, but it seems thoroughly foreign once you arrive in the country.</p>
<p>Locals are using unfamiliar slang, and they may use several words to express the same thing. Sometimes this makes you feel like a stranger, but take it as a learning opportunity. Most local people appreciate you trying to communicate with them in their native language.</p>
<p>While it may seem like a significant obstacle to overcome, the more you practice, the more comfortable you will become. In addition to becoming familiar with the country&#8217;s language and currency, you will also have to adjust to the local culture.</p>

<h3><strong>5.Challenges of International Students in Canada: Staying Active</strong></h3>
<p>The international students are exposed to new environments, so they may find it challenging to stay active all through. Some of them are usually used to doing different activities that keep them fit and happy.</p>
<p>Still, when they travel to Canada for studies, they manage to spend most of the time in classes, completing tasks, or even studying for exams. Also, students may have to eat different foods that they are not used to. Such things make them miserable and inactive since there is limited freedom.</p>
<p>The best way for students to recover satisfaction and to stay active is through engaging in different activities they used to do, such as going to the gym or availing themselves in the recreational zones.</p>
<p>Most students work hard to get the best out of the energy invested. However, progress may not be permanently guaranteed even after working hard. Some students find it difficult to tackle some academic stuff such as mathematical exercises and essays.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this problem is caused by the language barrier. Students may have the concept towards a specific question but putting it better in English for the lecturers to understand them becomes challenging.</p>
<p>Therefore, English is essential, and every student is supposed to have a good awareness of the language if they want to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>International students should first recognize the area they are weak in and seek help from the proper people. For example, when they are stuck with tasks, it is better to ask the professors and instructors to offer them other tutorials.</p>
<p>If the professors or instructors are busy, they can&#8217;t help students; they may refer them to different resources to find helpful information. It means students shouldn&#8217;t shy away from the people who can help them face the challenges of international students in Canada.</p>
