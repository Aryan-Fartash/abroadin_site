<p>Working part-time while you study is a fantastic way to offset these costs and gain valuable experience in the Canadian job market. Here&#8217;s what you need to know before applying for part-time work in Canada:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Securing a Social Insurance Number</h3>
<p>Everyone working in Canada, regardless of citizenship status (citizen, permanent resident, or international student), requires a Social Insurance Number (SIN).</p>
<p>The application process through the federal government is relatively straightforward, and it&#8217;s recommended to apply before arriving in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>International Students Work Permit Restrictions</h3>
<p>Some conditions are associated with working as an international student in Canada. For instance, you can only begin working once your academic semester starts. While you can search for a job upon arrival, you can officially start then.</p>

<h3>Temporary Relaxation of Hour Limits</h3>
<p>The good news is that the government has temporarily lifted one of the work restrictions for international students. Previously, they were limited to working a maximum of 20 hours per week during the school term. This limit has been waived until the second notice.</p>
<p>It provides more flexibility for students who may have previously struggled to find employers willing to accommodate the 20-hour cap. Remember, while you can now take on more shifts, prioritize your studies and maintain a healthy balance.</p>
<p>Here are the specific requirements for students to qualify for the waived 20-hour limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold a valid study permit.</li>
<li>Be enrolled full-time (or part-time during your final academic session).</li>
<li>Have a study permit application (or extension) submitted to IRCC on or before October 7, 2024.</li>
<li>Have a study permit with a condition allowing off-campus work.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>New Work Permit Rules for International Students</h3>
<p>On January 22, 2024, Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Minister Marc Miller announced a two-year temporary cap on the number of new study permits issued to international students annually.</p>
<p>This cap is expected to significantly reduce the number of study permits issued in 2024. The federal government aims to approve approximately 360,000 undergraduate permits—a 35% decrease.</p>
<p>The cap will be distributed proportionally based on provincial populations, potentially leading to a steeper decline (up to 50%) for provinces like Ontario and British Columbia.</p>
<p>While the cap excludes graduate and professional students as well as those applying for elementary or secondary school permits, additional changes impact international students&#8217; work permit availability.</p>
<p>Effective September 1, 2024, postgraduate work permits will no longer be available to graduates of public-private institutions. Additionally, open international students&#8217; work permit eligibility for their spouses will be restricted to spouses of graduate and professional students only.</p>
<p>These new limitations could pose challenges for the Canadian labor market, which already grapples with significant skill gaps and relies heavily on foreign workers in many sectors.</p>

<h2>The US, Work Restrictions for International Students</h2>
<p>To study full-time in the United States, you&#8217;ll typically need an F or M visa, both designated for international students.</p>
<p>Eligibility for either F-1 or M-1 visas hinges on these key requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enrollment in an approved academic, language training, or vocational program.</li>
<li>Your school must be authorized by the Student and Exchange Visitors Program (SEVP)</li>
<li>Full-time student status at the institution.</li>
<li>English proficiency or enrollment in English language courses.</li>
<li>Sufficient financial resources to cover your entire study period.</li>
<li>Maintaining a foreign residence, you intend to return to.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>F-1 Student Visa</h3>
<p>Specifically, the F-1 Visa allows full-time study at accredited institutions like colleges, universities, high schools, and language training programs. The program must offer a degree, diploma, or certificate, and the US government must authorize your school to enroll international students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>M-1 Student Visa</h3>
<p>The M-1 visa caters to international students seeking vocational or practical skills outside of traditional academic programs and language training.</p>
<p>These programs focus on hands-on learning and equip students with industry-specific knowledge and certifications in fields such as cosmetology, automotive repair, or computer networking.</p>
<p>However, unlike F-1 student visa holders, M-1 visa holders generally cannot work off-campus until they have completed their studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Employment for International Students</h3>
<p>There are work restrictions for international students with F-1 visas. During the first year, they can only work on campus under specific conditions. After the first year, F-1 students have options for off-campus work authorization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Curricular Practical Training (CPT):</strong> This allows for work directly related to their field of study.</li>
<li><strong>Optional Practical Training (OPT):</strong> This can be pre-completion (during studies) or post-completion (after graduation).</li>
<li><strong>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics OPT:</strong> This extends the OPT period for students in STEM fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>In special circumstances, such as severe economic hardship, F-1 students may be eligible for additional off-campus work authorization on a case-by-case basis. M-1 students can only participate in practical training after completing their studies.</p>
<p>For both F-1 and M-1 students, any off-campus work must be related to their area of study and needs prior approval from the Designated School Official (DHS) and USCIS.</p>

<h3>New Guidance Simplifies Rules for F and M Visa Holders</h3>
<p>The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) recently updated its policy guidance for F and M student visas. It clarifies regulations and streamlines the process for international students seeking work opportunities in the US. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the key changes and how they impact you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Maintaining Foreign Residence</h4>
<p>The policy emphasizes maintaining a foreign residence while studying in the US. However, it acknowledges that students can explore permanent residency options like green cards. The emphasis remains on demonstrating your intention to return home after completing your studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>STEM Students Get a Boost</h4>
<p>The update allows F-1 students in STEM fields to extend their Optional Practical Training (OPT) and work with startup companies. It opens doors to valuable experience and broader career opportunities.</p>
<p>But remember, both students and employers need to comply with work restrictions for international students and specific requirements like outlined training plans and fair compensation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Clearer Guidelines for All</h4>
<p>USCIS has provided more detailed explanations regarding maintaining student status, including transferring schools, exploring work options, and applying for various benefits. This clarity empowers students to make informed decisions but also emphasizes the need to ensure their activities align with visa regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Planning for the Future</h4>
<p>Whether considering long-term residency or post-graduation employment, factor in these updated guidelines. It’s up to you to stay informed about immigration policies that might affect your status.</p>
<p>USCIS&#8217;s revised policy aims to simplify the student visa system, benefiting both students and employers. For students, it opens doors to new career opportunities and clarifies pathways to permanent residency.</p>
<p>Employers gain access to a wider talent pool, particularly in STEM fields. With a focus on compliance and expert guidance, this revised guidance fosters an environment of growth and mutual benefit for international students and American companies.</p>

<h2>Europe, How many Hours can International Students Work</h2>
<p>Many European countries allow international students on visas to work part-time, but limitations on the number of hours may vary. This opportunity to work attracts students seeking financial support or valuable work experience.</p>
<p>However, navigating employment regulations as a student requires understanding the specific rules of each country. Employment rights for international students depend on several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Student&#8217;s Home Country:</strong> Regulations might differ based on your nationality.</li>
<li><strong>Host Country&#8217;s Laws:</strong> Each European nation has its own set of employment laws.</li>
<li><strong>Type of Visa Held:</strong> The type of visa you possess will determine your work eligibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students from the European Union (EU) generally enjoy the same employment rights as citizens of their host country. However, non-EU students may face some restrictions.</p>
<p>In most European countries, international students with appropriate visas can typically work part-time while studying. The permitted number of hours can vary, and some countries might have additional limitations on the types of jobs students can take or the total duration of allowed work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s crucial to research the specific regulations in your chosen European destination before starting your studies. Let&#8217;s explore some specific examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>France:</strong> International students can work part-time, with a maximum of 20 hours per week, even during their first year.</li>
<li><strong>Spain:</strong> Non-EU students on a student visa can work up to 20 hours per week.</li>
<li><strong>UK:</strong> International students on a Tier 4 visa can work up to 20 hours per week during term time and full-time during academic breaks.</li>
<li><strong>Denmark:</strong> Students can work up to 20 hours per week during the school year and full-time during breaks.</li>
<li><strong>Estonia:</strong> There are no work restrictions for international students on work hours for those who maintain passing grades.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding and adhering to these regulations allows international students to make informed decisions about work opportunities while studying in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Working as an international student offers financial support and valuable experience. Whether in Canada, the US, or Europe, navigate international students&#8217; work permit regulations carefully. Research your chosen country&#8217;s limitations and seek guidance from official sources or university career services.</p>
<p>With informed decisions, international student work can enrich your studies and career path. Read the other blog posts in Abroadin for more specific information about work restrictions for international students in each country.</p>

The job should be one typically filled by students.</p><p>Positions such as cafeteria, library, or bookstore roles and positions as teaching or research assistants in campus science labs or under professors are likely to meet this criterion.</p><p>On-campus employment is also permitted if it&#8217;s part of a <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">scholarship</span> or <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">fellowship</span> and aligns with your academic program.</p><p>Sometimes, such work can extend off campus if it&#8217;s still educationally related to or affiliated with the school. For instance, working with a professor at an off-campus research facility.</p><p>Your DSO can advise if off-campus employment is permissible within the boundaries of on-campus work.</p><p>The graduate students are often offered stipends in exchange for serving as teaching and research assistants. Since a <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">stipend constitutes compensation</span>, it&#8217;s considered paid work by US immigration authorities.</p><p>Like other employment, receiving a graduate stipend from the university is acceptable under F-1 status if the work is conducted on campus, payment is directly from the university, and weekly work hours do not exceed<span style="background-color: #99ccff;"> 20 during the academic term.</span></p><p>Upon completion of your studies, you must cease on-campus employment. However, you may be eligible for authorization to remain in the United States and engage in paid practical training.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2183" src="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jeswin-thomas-hgJu2ykh4E-unsplash-300x195.webp" alt="working on a student visa" width="1103" height="717" srcset="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jeswin-thomas-hgJu2ykh4E-unsplash-300x195.webp 300w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jeswin-thomas-hgJu2ykh4E-unsplash-1024x665.webp 1024w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jeswin-thomas-hgJu2ykh4E-unsplash-768x499.webp 768w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jeswin-thomas-hgJu2ykh4E-unsplash-1536x998.webp 1536w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jeswin-thomas-hgJu2ykh4E-unsplash-2048x1331.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1103px) 100vw, 1103px" /></p><h2>Working Off-Campus Due to Severe Economic Hardship</h2><p>Despite your best efforts to maintain financial independence, unexpected circumstances can arise. Perhaps a parent loses a job, a scholarship foundation faces bankruptcy, currency devaluation occurs, tuition costs escalate, or a natural disaster strikes your home country.</p><p>Fortunately, US immigration laws offer provisions for such situations. If you demonstrate that unforeseen circumstances beyond your control have led to severe economic hardship, you may be eligible for <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">permission to work off-campus</span> for an external employer.</p><p>The process becomes simpler in cases where a significant event impacts your entire country, leading the US government to invoke the <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">Special Student Relief (SSR) program</span> and temporarily relax some regulations for all qualified applicants from your country.</p><p>While you&#8217;ll still need a permit for working on a student visa and prove your hardship, demonstrating the cause of hardship becomes less burdensome under SSR designation.</p><p>If you&#8217;ve been studying for less than a year, you&#8217;re typically responsible for navigating such challenges independently unless covered under an SSR designation that waives this requirement.</p><p>In such cases, you won&#8217;t qualify for special work authorization and may need to explore alternative means to cover expenses. Returning home and considering reapplying for a student visa later might be your only option.</p><p>For students who have completed a <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">full academic year</span>, maintain good academic standing, and cannot secure suitable on-campus employment to meet their financial needs, applying to the USCIS for off-campus work authorization is an option.</p><p>Even if currently employed on-campus, switching to off-campus work is permissible, especially if it offers better pay.</p><p>Work hours are limited to <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">20 per week during the academic term</span> but can extend to full-time during school breaks or vacations.</p><p>if you want to know the answer of <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://abroadin.com/blog/why-study-in-the-usa/">Why Study in the USA</a></span> read this article:</p><p><div class="jupiterx-oembed"><blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="a7eFcrLXac"><a href="https://abroadin.com/blog/why-study-in-the-usa/">Why Study in the USA | 7 Reasons to Pack Your Bags Today!</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Why Study in the USA | 7 Reasons to Pack Your Bags Today!&#8221; &#8212; Abroadin " src="https://abroadin.com/blog/why-study-in-the-usa/embed/#?secret=3l29HzyFRN#?secret=a7eFcrLXac" data-secret="a7eFcrLXac" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></p><h3>How to Apply for Off-Campus Work?</h3><p>To <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">apply for off-campus</span> work authorization, you must complete <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">USCIS Form I-765</span>.

Compensation for this work may vary.</p><p>For instance, if you&#8217;re studying psychology and your program mandates you to gain credit or fulfill graduation requirements by working at a facility or hospital, this would qualify as curricular practical training.</p><p>Even if the work<span style="background-color: #99ccff;"> isn&#8217;t obligatory</span>, if it&#8217;s listed as &#8220;elective&#8221; in the school&#8217;s catalog, overseen by a faculty member, and offers academic credit, it could qualify as curricular practical training.</p><p>Curricular practical training is available to students who have completed at least <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">one academic year</span> at the college level or higher. An exception exists for graduate programs that necessitate immediate participation in such training.</p><p>Engaging in one year of full-time practical training during your studies will render you <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">ineligible</span> for further practical training post-completion.</p><p>It may result in forfeiting the opportunity to spend additional time in the United States post-graduation. To circumvent this issue, opt for less than one year of curricular practical training or ensure your participation is part-time rather than full-time.</p><p>For curricular practical training, you do not require prior permission from USCIS. The only procedural steps for working on a student visa involve your DSO:</p><ul><li>Approving your proposed plan</li><li>Reporting your authorization for curricular practical training to SEVIS</li><li>Endorsing your SEVIS I-20 to reflect this approval.</li></ul><p>Under this process, you&#8217;ll be authorized for the duration outlined in your curricular practical training plan. The approved dates will be indicated on your<span style="background-color: #99ccff;"> I-20 form</span>.</p><p>Unlike other off-campus work arrangements, you won&#8217;t need a separate work permit card, an <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">&#8220;employment authorization document&#8221;</span> or<span style="background-color: #99ccff;"> &#8220;EAD.&#8221;</span></p><p>if you need more information about <a href="https://abroadin.com/blog/us-student-visa-for-indian-students-conditions-and-requirements-for-2024/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">US Student Visa for Indian Students</span></a> read this article:</p><p><div class="jupiterx-oembed"><blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UT3ScIbcQn"><a href="https://abroadin.com/blog/us-student-visa-for-indian-students-conditions-and-requirements-for-2024/">US Student Visa for Indian Students + Conditions and Requirements for 2024</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;US Student Visa for Indian Students + Conditions and Requirements for 2024&#8221; &#8212; Abroadin " src="https://abroadin.com/blog/us-student-visa-for-indian-students-conditions-and-requirements-for-2024/embed/#?secret=MgfE3FgLX7#?secret=UT3ScIbcQn" data-secret="UT3ScIbcQn" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></p><h2>Optional Practical Training for F-1 Students</h2><p><span style="background-color: #99ccff;">Optional practical training (OPT)</span> provides another avenue for off-campus work for F-1 students. Unlike curricular practical training, OPT doesn&#8217;t need to be a specific part of the <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">university&#8217;s offerings</span>. However, it must be related to your studies and directly tied to your major.</p><p>The work you undertake during OPT must align with your field of study. For instance, working at a coffee shop while enrolled in a nursing program wouldn&#8217;t meet USCIS requirements. The training must be relevant to your major and commensurate with your educational level.</p><p>Unlike curricular practical training, you&#8217;ll need a work permit card and an <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">&#8220;employment authorization document&#8221; (EAD)</span>, which you&#8217;ll apply for using <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">USCIS Form I-765.</span> Your eligibility category is <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">(c)(3)(A)</span> if you haven&#8217;t completed your studies yet and <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">(c)(3)(B)</span> if you have.</p><p>OPT is available only to students who have completed at least one academic year at the college level or higher. The maximum duration for full-time OPT is one year. Part-time employment is permissible before program completion, with hours deducted from the one-year maximum at half the rate.</p><p>You can undertake OPT while school is in session <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">(for 20 hours a week or less)</span>, during breaks, after meeting degree requirements, or after graduation, as long as the training period concludes within 14 months.</p><p>Work can be full-time or part-time before program completion, but must be full-time after. Be mindful not to exhaust your OPT prematurely. Engaging in one or more years of full-time practical training during your studies will render you ineligible for further practical training post-graduation.</p><p>If you completed a degree in science, technology, engineering, or math, you&#8217;re eligible for a <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">24-month extension</span> of your OPT, commonly known as a <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">STEM extension</span>.</p><p>F-1 students pursuing STEM OPT extensions may work for new start-up businesses, provided all regulatory requirements of working on a student visa are met.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>This Abroadin article covered many tips and points about working on a student visa for international students.

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Finding Job in Europe after Graduation</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Graduating from a higher education program in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA) can open doors to exciting possibilities for international students.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">These opportunities vary from country to country, offering non-EU/EEA graduates a chance to stay and explore their host country&#8217;s job market.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Let us check out some of these options for finding job in Europe after graduation:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Temporary stay durations: Upon completing their studies, non-EU/EEA graduates often receive the opportunity to remain in their host country for a specified period. The duration of this stay varies widely across EU countries. For instance, Denmark extends this privilege for up to six months, while Germany offers an extended window of up to 18 months.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Visa extensions and residence permits: The mechanisms for facilitating this transition also differ. This opportunity is seamlessly integrated into the student residence visa extension in some EU nations. In some other countries, non-EU/EEA graduates may need to obtain a separate temporary residence permit.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Dedicated job search permits: Some EU countries take the concept a step further by introducing dedicated job search permits. These permits facilitate the pursuit of employment, streamlining the process for graduates eager to land their dream job in a foreign land.</span></li>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Extending Your Visa for Job Hunting</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You may need to apply for a visa extension in many EU countries to explore job opportunities. It is a crucial phase in your post-graduation plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here is what you need to know without checking unnecessary details:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Visa extension essentials: In several EU Member States, securing a job-seeking visa extension is a prerequisite for your post-graduation job hunt. Timing is critical here. To avoid disruptions in your stay, ensure that you initiate this process well in advance, ideally, before your study residence permit expires. This proactive approach prevents last-minute stress and complications.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Seeking guidance: Your higher education institution, where you completed your studies, can be a valuable resource in this step. They might offer guidance for the visa extension process, easing your transition into the next chapter of your life. Consider it as seeking advice from a trusted mentor; their expertise can prove invaluable.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Stay informed: Remember that visa regulations can change, and you are responsible for staying informed about the latest updates. Regularly checking official sources and being proactive in understanding the conditions for visa extensions ensures a smoother process.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Securing a job offer is critical to unlocking longer-term work opportunities in the European Union. If you do this, you may become eligible to pursue options like the EU Blue Card or other extended residence permits under each country&#8217;s regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">These longer-term permits grant you the stability and flexibility to work and thrive in your chosen destination.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">They signify a more profound commitment to your professional journey on European soil, ensuring that your career aspirations align seamlessly with the continent&#8217;s dynamic opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So, remember, your job offer is not just a doorway but also a pathway to your future in the European Union.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">Each country has its regulations regarding work permissions for international students. Sometimes, you may need a work permit and a student visa.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is essential to thoroughly research the specific requirements and restrictions imposed by the country you plan to study in.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Consult with your study abroad program administrators and the host country embassy to ensure compliance with work regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Depending on the country&#8217;s regulations, student status may also allow for part-time work or employment during vacation periods.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is essential to consider the potential challenges of working through an overseas university, as it may delay progress toward earning a degree or developing a career.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Working for International Students in Canada</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you&#8217;re an international student in Canada, find a proper job, which you can pursue while studying for your degree. This way, you can financially support yourself while focusing on your studies and adding a bonus to your resume for the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">However, you need to know the working regulations and where to look to find a student job as an international student. In the following, you find information about the job opportunities in Canada during the year or holidays and where to look for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">After you begin your studies, you can work both on and off-campus. Keep in mind that as a student, you are allowed to work under the following conditions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">part-time job during semesters: up to 20 hours per week;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">full-time job during holidays: up to 40 hours per week.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You even can apply for an internship position or add special attention to your resume by volunteering. Thanks to Canada&#8217;s many support programs, these opportunities can be easy to reach, even for an international student.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The most widespread support program for finding a job as an international student in Canada is the Youth Employment Strategy, which concentrates on three streams:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Skills Link,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Career Focus,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">and Canada Summer Jobs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you&#8217;re looking for a summer or part-time job as an international student in Canada, first, you should make sure you are eligible for that. To qualify for a job off-campus, you should have the following criteria:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Have a social insurance number (SIN);</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Be a full-time student with a study permit;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Be registered at a designated learning institution (DLI) at the post-secondary level or, you must study in a vocational program in Quebec;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Be in an academic or professional training program that finishes in a certificate or a degree.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you want to work on-campus, you don&#8217;t require a work permit or a social insurance number, and you can also exceed the 20 hours per week limit during semesters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Job Opportunities in Canada for International Students</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Before you start searching for job opportunities in Canada you should get a Social Insurance Number or SIN, which will require working. It&#8217;s helpful if you also had it to have access to the national programs and other benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Some specific jobs require a minimum age which differs according to the provinces of Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Besides writing your resume, cover letter and preparing for the interviews, you can check out the websites for career opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">There also is a hidden job market in Canada, based on recommendations, so you are advised to develop your intended network and make connections with people that can help you. A few ways to expand your network include:</span></p>

<li><span style="color: #333333;">Participating in information sessions and business meetings.</span></li>

<h2><span style="color: #333300;">Eligibility for Working as an International Student in Canada</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">International students with a study permit, who enrolled in the Designated Learning Institutions (DLI) full-time, can work off-campus without a work permit. It means they can work for any employer in any business in Canada. International students can also work on campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">Working off-campus means working for any employer outside of the university. Working on-campus means working for any employer on the university&#8217;s campus, such as working for the university itself, a faculty member, a research assistant, a student organization, or a private contractor providing campus services.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">You even may work for yourself if you have established a business off-campus. It is essential to regard that even if you plan to work while studying in Canada, you will still need to prove financial resources when applying for a study permit. It means you have to show you have enough funds to support yourself during studying in Canada without working.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">Anticipated future earnings will not satisfy when confirming financial resources, so you may plan to be working while studying in Canada will not fulfill the condition to prove financial capacity before arrival to the country.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333300;">Study Permit and Working Limits in Canada</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">Your study permit says whether you are permitted to work in Canada and the conditions of employment. This record enables you to apply for a Social Insurance Number (SIN) from Service Canada. Receiving a SIN is a crucial requirement before you can begin working while studying in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">If your study permit is missing the record, you need to apply for a SIN; you can get your study permit revised for free. You can do this after your arrival, but it&#8217;s much easier to do it when your study permit is first issued. When you go to Canada&#8217;s Immigration office, you can ask the intended officer about your permission to work if you are uncertain about anything on your study permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">You cannot work in this country unless otherwise authorized to do so if your study program is less than six months or enrolled in French as a Second Language (FSL) or English as a Second Language (ESL) program. Visiting students or exchange students at a DLI are not permitted to work while studying in this country.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">It would help keep in mind that you cannot start working while studying in Canada until you begin your study program. It is one of the working limits in Canada you should consider.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333300;">Finding a Job for Working while Studying in Canada</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">Being eligible to work in Canada may be the easiest part! The next step in this path is to find a job. Employers in Canada are often interested in hiring students for part-time positions, and there are many positions in this country.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">Before you start searching for a job or applying, you must prepare your resume and cover letter. These are your best chance to catch an employer&#8217;s attention and stand out as the best candidate for the intended job. Your resume should be up to date and formatted for the expectations of Canadian employers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">Your cover letter is your chance to show your character and achievements. Write a cover letter for each position, highlighting how you fit the specific standards they&#8217;re looking for. If you&#8217;re planning to apply online, the cover letter can be your introductory email, to which you attach your resume or CV as a PDF.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">There are some places you can start looking for jobs in Canada:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Websites such as Monster and Craigslist have hundreds of postings for part-time employment;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333300;">Your city may have its portal for jobs, such as at recreation centers or libraries;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333300;">You could also walk around the neighborhood and see if shops or restaurants are advertising in the window for employees.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">If somewhere looks assuring, feel free to ask to speak to someone about the situation. It is an excellent chance to make an excellent first impression. It could turn into a job interview. Networking your path to success in this way is a tested formula.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">There is a strong history of working while studying in Canada, and you shouldn&#8217;t hide the fact that you&#8217;re an international student. Remember that your exams and studies come first, and don&#8217;t be shy to ask for the time off you need during exam times.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">Students who study and work in Canada have the same rights as other workers in this country, and you should know what your labor rights are and the minimum wage in the province of your residence. Make sure to receive payslips and the proper record of employment so that you can file your tax return.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333300;">Co-op Work Permit in Canada</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">While international students in Canada usually don&#8217;t need a separate work permit to work while studying, there is a significant exception. Some education programs require the student to complete a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/intern.html">Co-op or internship</a> work placement to graduate. In this situation, international students need a co-op work permit plus their education permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">To obtain a Co-op work permit, you&#8217;ll need a legitimate study permit and a letter from your university confirming all students in your program need to complete work arrangements to get their university degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">The co-op work permit may be issued with your study permit. If your acceptance letter says that an internship or co-op placement is required as part of your education program, your work permit may be processed as part of your permit application.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">It is also plausible to apply for a co-op work permit after you have already received your study permit, and you can apply by paper or even online. Your university should help you with this, as the placement is part of your study program, and they seemingly help many international students apply for this permit each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">Keep in mind that some employers in Canada pay employees by debit, straight into your account. Consequently, it is essential to have a bank account set up and have the aspects of your budget available so that your employer can pay you.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333300;">Working Limits in Canada after Graduation</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333300;"><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/eligibility.html#:~:text=You%20can%20apply%20for%20a,attended%20and%20completed%20your%20program">Once you&#8217;ve finished your studies</a>, you may stop working immediately as one of the working limits in Canada after graduation from university. However, there are some ways to continue working under different conditions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333300;">You may apply for a PGWP (Post-Graduation Work Permit), allowing you to work for any employer for up to three years after graduation. If you&#8217;re eligible and you want to stay in Canada, you need to apply within 180 days of receiving confirmation that you&#8217;ve finished your education program;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333300;">If you are beginning a new study program, you can continue working between the study programs, under these circumstances if you:</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333300;">You were eligible to work off-campus during your previous study program;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333300;">You still have a valid study permit or applied for an extension before your permit expired;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333300;">You have received written confirmation that you completed your program;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333300;">You have received a letter of acceptance to a new full-time study program at a DLI;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333300;">You will start your new study program within 150 days of receiving confirmation that you finished your previous program.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="color: #333300;">If you don&#8217;t apply for the intended PGWP and decide to come back to work momentarily, you may be qualified for one of the International Experience Canada (IEC) categories. They offer young people from different countries the opportunity to work in Canada for one or two years, depending on the category and country of citizenship.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">Working while studying in Canada can be fulfilling beyond the wage you earn. Graduating from a university in Canada with additional work experience could make you stand out from the crowd during future job hunts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">Whether you intend to stay in Canada or work abroad after graduation, Canadian work experience can be a helpful asset to your future goals. Learning more and more about working limits in Canada helps you to achieve your goals in this path.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333300;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">Working while studying is one of Canada&#8217;s significant advantages as the destination for higher education. However, you should know some points before you begin earning about working limits in Canada and North America.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333300;">Most international students in this country can work for up to 20 hours per week and full-time during breaks without a work permit. Working while studying in Canada can help support yourself and meet new people while building connections and experience.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Human Resources, a Field of Study for Job Seekers</strong></span></h3>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">A social science credential in a relevant area of psychology or sociology is also an acceptable option. Some organizations prefer to hire those who have a degree and hold the Chartered Professional in Human Resources (CPHR) class to be an asset.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>The Bachelor of Human Resources</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To get there, you should start with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in human resources, but the difference between the Bachelor of Human Resources and Labor Relations (BHRLR) and the Bachelor of Management in Human Resources Management or Bachelor of Management in HRM?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The Bachelor of Management in Human Resources Management is a four-year degree, but the Bachelor of Human Resources and Labor Relations is a three-year degree. If a student wants to pursue graduate studies, a four-year degree may be a better choice since many universities have an entrance requirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Some universities let students complete the three-year Bachelor of Management degree and convert to the four-year Bachelor of Management in Human Resources Management.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Working Limits in Europe for Student Visa</h2>
<p>International students in Europe may get a job abroad out of financial necessity or gain employment experience. Either way, they have to obey laws in the process.</p>
<p>These regulations vary depending on the student&#8217;s home country and the destined country. This section explores some of the significant rules on the books in some popular countries for international students.</p>
<p>Remember, every country updates rules frequently, so it is best to check the official websites to read the latest regulations before traveling and studying.</p>
<p>As EU citizens, students have the same right to work while studying as nationals of that country. They do not need a student&#8217;s work permit, even to work full-time.</p>
<p>Most European countries allow students on a visa to work part-time, but some countries place restrictions on the hours every visa holder can work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>France</h3>
<p>While studying in France, international students can work part-time even if they are in the program&#8217;s first year or are pursuing a language course.</p>
<p>For non-EU citizens, they must have a student resident permit. French law authorizes international students to work 964 hours during the year, the equivalent of 60 percent of the full-time employment hours for the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Germany | Working Limits in Europe</h3>
<p>International students outside the EU or EEA who want to study in Germany face <a href="https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/study-training/studies-in-germany/work#:~:text=Students%20from%20EU%2FEEA%20countries,can%20earn%20during%20semester%20breaks.">work-hour restrictions.</a></p>
<p>According to the German Academic Exchange Service, these students are limited to 120 full work days or 240 half workdays per year unless they gain special government approval.</p>
<p>International students who work as research assistants on campus do not face time restrictions, although they need to consult the government during the application process.</p>
<p>University career services offices are a resource that international students can tap to get further tips about looking for jobs and navigating the application process. It is a standard procedure in all European countries.</p>
<p>If students are from outside the European Union but have a valid student visa, they can work 120 workdays or 240 work half-days annually. EU students can work 20 hours a week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Russia</h3>
<p>The Russian government recently prepared a proposal enabling students to work up to four hours per day or 20 hours per week outside the university without a supplementary permit.</p>
<p>One of the most sought-after part-time jobs for international students in Russia is language teaching. Russians pay decent money to learn a language from a native. Depending on experience and the level of the student, they could be paid up to USD 50 an hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Spain | Working Limits in Europe</h3>
<p>A non-European citizen can work up to 20 hours per week in Spain under a student visa. International students with a student visa can work up to 4 hours per day on a particular work permit.</p>
<p>This permit is not difficult to get, but students and companies often prefer full-time work. International students may earn up to EUR 20 an hour part-time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The UK</h3>
<p>International students at United Kingdom universities who do not hold citizenship for EU or EEA countries can have jobs. Still, there are working limits in Europe to the number of hours they can clock.</p>
<p>According to the Council for International Student Affairs of the UK, international students who hold a Tier 4 (General) visa and are studying at an approved institution can work 20 hours per week during the semester.</p>
<p>The same students can work full time during breaks in the academic year.</p>
<p>EU or EEA students can work in the UK without restriction. Non-EU students with a general student visa can work up to 20 hours per week during term time or full-time during university holidays.</p>
