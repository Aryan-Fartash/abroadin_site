<p>Dreaming of studying abroad but worried about the costs? This Abroadin guide explores how international students in Canada, the US, and Europe can leverage part-time work to offset expenses and gain valuable experience. We explore work permit requirements, work restrictions for international students, and visa restrictions across these popular destinations. Let’s turn your study abroad dreams into reality!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canada, International Students Work Permit</li>
<li>The US, Work Restrictions for International Students</li>
<li>Europe, How many Hours can International Students Work</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Canada, International Students Work Permit</h2>
<p>Coming to Canada is a significant undertaking, and the costs can add up quickly. In addition to tuition, rent, and groceries, you&#8217;ll likely want to explore the country and enjoy social activities with friends.</p>
<p>Working part-time while you study is a fantastic way to offset these costs and gain valuable experience in the Canadian job market. Here&#8217;s what you need to know before applying for part-time work in Canada:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Securing a Social Insurance Number</h3>
<p>Everyone working in Canada, regardless of citizenship status (citizen, permanent resident, or international student), requires a Social Insurance Number (SIN).</p>
<p>The application process through the federal government is relatively straightforward, and it&#8217;s recommended to apply before arriving in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>International Students Work Permit Restrictions</h3>
<p>Some conditions are associated with working as an international student in Canada. For instance, you can only begin working once your academic semester starts. While you can search for a job upon arrival, you can officially start then.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2238" src="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kyle-glenn-nXt5HtLmlgE-unsplash-300x200.webp" alt="international students work permit" width="1072" height="714" srcset="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kyle-glenn-nXt5HtLmlgE-unsplash-300x200.webp 300w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kyle-glenn-nXt5HtLmlgE-unsplash-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kyle-glenn-nXt5HtLmlgE-unsplash-768x512.webp 768w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kyle-glenn-nXt5HtLmlgE-unsplash-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kyle-glenn-nXt5HtLmlgE-unsplash-2048x1365.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px" /></p>
<h3>Temporary Relaxation of Hour Limits</h3>
<p>The good news is that the government has temporarily lifted one of the work restrictions for international students. Previously, they were limited to working a maximum of 20 hours per week during the school term. This limit has been waived until the second notice.</p>
<p>It provides more flexibility for students who may have previously struggled to find employers willing to accommodate the 20-hour cap. Remember, while you can now take on more shifts, prioritize your studies and maintain a healthy balance.</p>
<p>Here are the specific requirements for students to qualify for the waived 20-hour limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold a valid study permit.</li>
<li>Be enrolled full-time (or part-time during your final academic session).</li>
<li>Have a study permit application (or extension) submitted to IRCC on or before October 7, 2024.</li>
<li>Have a study permit with a condition allowing off-campus work.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>New Work Permit Rules for International Students</h3>
<p>On January 22, 2024, Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Minister Marc Miller announced a two-year temporary cap on the number of new study permits issued to international students annually.</p>
<p>This cap is expected to significantly reduce the number of study permits issued in 2024. The federal government aims to approve approximately 360,000 undergraduate permits—a 35% decrease.</p>
<p>The cap will be distributed proportionally based on provincial populations, potentially leading to a steeper decline (up to 50%) for provinces like Ontario and British Columbia.</p>
<p>While the cap excludes graduate and professional students as well as those applying for elementary or secondary school permits, additional changes impact international students&#8217; work permit availability.</p>
<p>Effective September 1, 2024, postgraduate work permits will no longer be available to graduates of public-private institutions. Additionally, open international students&#8217; work permit eligibility for their spouses will be restricted to spouses of graduate and professional students only.</p>
<p>These new limitations could pose challenges for the Canadian labor market, which already grapples with significant skill gaps and relies heavily on foreign workers in many sectors.</p>

<h2>The US, Work Restrictions for International Students</h2>
<p>To study full-time in the United States, you&#8217;ll typically need an F or M visa, both designated for international students.</p>
<p>Eligibility for either F-1 or M-1 visas hinges on these key requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enrollment in an approved academic, language training, or vocational program.</li>
<li>Your school must be authorized by the Student and Exchange Visitors Program (SEVP)</li>
<li>Full-time student status at the institution.</li>
<li>English proficiency or enrollment in English language courses.</li>
<li>Sufficient financial resources to cover your entire study period.</li>
<li>Maintaining a foreign residence, you intend to return to.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>F-1 Student Visa</h3>
<p>Specifically, the F-1 Visa allows full-time study at accredited institutions like colleges, universities, high schools, and language training programs. The program must offer a degree, diploma, or certificate, and the US government must authorize your school to enroll international students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>M-1 Student Visa</h3>
<p>The M-1 visa caters to international students seeking vocational or practical skills outside of traditional academic programs and language training.</p>
<p>These programs focus on hands-on learning and equip students with industry-specific knowledge and certifications in fields such as cosmetology, automotive repair, or computer networking.</p>
<p>However, unlike F-1 student visa holders, M-1 visa holders generally cannot work off-campus until they have completed their studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Employment for International Students</h3>
<p>There are work restrictions for international students with F-1 visas. During the first year, they can only work on campus under specific conditions. After the first year, F-1 students have options for off-campus work authorization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Curricular Practical Training (CPT):</strong> This allows for work directly related to their field of study.</li>
<li><strong>Optional Practical Training (OPT):</strong> This can be pre-completion (during studies) or post-completion (after graduation).</li>
<li><strong>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics OPT:</strong> This extends the OPT period for students in STEM fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>In special circumstances, such as severe economic hardship, F-1 students may be eligible for additional off-campus work authorization on a case-by-case basis. M-1 students can only participate in practical training after completing their studies.</p>
<p>For both F-1 and M-1 students, any off-campus work must be related to their area of study and needs prior approval from the Designated School Official (DHS) and USCIS.</p>

<h3>New Guidance Simplifies Rules for F and M Visa Holders</h3>
<p>The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) recently updated its policy guidance for F and M student visas. It clarifies regulations and streamlines the process for international students seeking work opportunities in the US. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the key changes and how they impact you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Maintaining Foreign Residence</h4>
<p>The policy emphasizes maintaining a foreign residence while studying in the US. However, it acknowledges that students can explore permanent residency options like green cards. The emphasis remains on demonstrating your intention to return home after completing your studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>STEM Students Get a Boost</h4>
<p>The update allows F-1 students in STEM fields to extend their Optional Practical Training (OPT) and work with startup companies. It opens doors to valuable experience and broader career opportunities.</p>
<p>But remember, both students and employers need to comply with work restrictions for international students and specific requirements like outlined training plans and fair compensation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Clearer Guidelines for All</h4>
<p>USCIS has provided more detailed explanations regarding maintaining student status, including transferring schools, exploring work options, and applying for various benefits. This clarity empowers students to make informed decisions but also emphasizes the need to ensure their activities align with visa regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Planning for the Future</h4>
<p>Whether considering long-term residency or post-graduation employment, factor in these updated guidelines. It’s up to you to stay informed about immigration policies that might affect your status.</p>
<p>USCIS&#8217;s revised policy aims to simplify the student visa system, benefiting both students and employers. For students, it opens doors to new career opportunities and clarifies pathways to permanent residency.</p>
<p>Employers gain access to a wider talent pool, particularly in STEM fields. With a focus on compliance and expert guidance, this revised guidance fosters an environment of growth and mutual benefit for international students and American companies.</p>

<h2>Europe, How many Hours can International Students Work</h2>
<p>Many European countries allow international students on visas to work part-time, but limitations on the number of hours may vary. This opportunity to work attracts students seeking financial support or valuable work experience.</p>
<p>However, navigating employment regulations as a student requires understanding the specific rules of each country. Employment rights for international students depend on several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Student&#8217;s Home Country:</strong> Regulations might differ based on your nationality.</li>
<li><strong>Host Country&#8217;s Laws:</strong> Each European nation has its own set of employment laws.</li>
<li><strong>Type of Visa Held:</strong> The type of visa you possess will determine your work eligibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students from the European Union (EU) generally enjoy the same employment rights as citizens of their host country. However, non-EU students may face some restrictions.</p>
<p>In most European countries, international students with appropriate visas can typically work part-time while studying. The permitted number of hours can vary, and some countries might have additional limitations on the types of jobs students can take or the total duration of allowed work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s crucial to research the specific regulations in your chosen European destination before starting your studies. Let&#8217;s explore some specific examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>France:</strong> International students can work part-time, with a maximum of 20 hours per week, even during their first year.</li>
<li><strong>Spain:</strong> Non-EU students on a student visa can work up to 20 hours per week.</li>
<li><strong>UK:</strong> International students on a Tier 4 visa can work up to 20 hours per week during term time and full-time during academic breaks.</li>
<li><strong>Denmark:</strong> Students can work up to 20 hours per week during the school year and full-time during breaks.</li>
<li><strong>Estonia:</strong> There are no work restrictions for international students on work hours for those who maintain passing grades.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding and adhering to these regulations allows international students to make informed decisions about work opportunities while studying in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Working as an international student offers financial support and valuable experience. Whether in Canada, the US, or Europe, navigate international students&#8217; work permit regulations carefully. Research your chosen country&#8217;s limitations and seek guidance from official sources or university career services.</p>
<p>With informed decisions, international student work can enrich your studies and career path. Read the other blog posts in Abroadin for more specific information about work restrictions for international students in each country.</p>

							<h1> </h1><p>International students in the United States are expected to cover all their expenses without having any paid employment. However, students with <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">F1 visas</span> have limited rights to do paid work. This Abroadin article explores all you need to know about working on a student visa in the US.</p><p>In this guide:</p><ul><li>Working on a Student Visa in the US</li><li>Working On-Campus as an F-1 Student</li><li>Working Off-Campus Due to Severe Economic Hardship</li><li>Curricular Practical Training for F-1 Students</li><li>Optional Practical Training for F-1 Students</li><li>Conclusion</li></ul><h2>Working on a Student Visa in the US</h2><p><span style="background-color: #99ccff;">F-1 visa</span> holders can work in almost any position on their campus without requiring official authorization from the government of the United States.</p><p>However, working off campus needs<span style="background-color: #99ccff;"> authorization</span>, which can be obtained through either the <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">Designated School Official (DSO)</span> or the <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">US Citizenship</span> and <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">Immigration Services (USCIS).</span></p><p><span style="background-color: #99ccff;">The DSO</span> has the authority to grant curricular practical training, while <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">the USCIS</span> can authorize specific types of off-campus employment, such as:</p><ul><li>Employment outside the campus due to severe economic hardship</li><li>Optional practical training, which can occur during or after completing the study program</li><li>Internships with international organizations</li></ul><p>Below are details regarding each type of employment, including whether a formal work permit card from the USCIS is required.</p><h2>Working On-Campus as an F-1 Student</h2><p>As an <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">F-1 student</span>, you can work on your school&#8217;s campus for up to <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">20 hours per academic week</span> and <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">full-time during school breaks.</span></p><p>However, there&#8217;s a crucial condition for working on a student visa: Before commencing work, <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">the DSO</span> must confirm that your job will not displace non-student US workers. The job should be one typically filled by students.</p><p>Positions such as cafeteria, library, or bookstore roles and positions as teaching or research assistants in campus science labs or under professors are likely to meet this criterion.</p><p>On-campus employment is also permitted if it&#8217;s part of a <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">scholarship</span> or <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">fellowship</span> and aligns with your academic program.</p><p>Sometimes, such work can extend off campus if it&#8217;s still educationally related to or affiliated with the school. For instance, working with a professor at an off-campus research facility.</p><p>Your DSO can advise if off-campus employment is permissible within the boundaries of on-campus work.</p><p>The graduate students are often offered stipends in exchange for serving as teaching and research assistants. Since a <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">stipend constitutes compensation</span>, it&#8217;s considered paid work by US immigration authorities.</p><p>Like other employment, receiving a graduate stipend from the university is acceptable under F-1 status if the work is conducted on campus, payment is directly from the university, and weekly work hours do not exceed<span style="background-color: #99ccff;"> 20 during the academic term.</span></p><p>Upon completion of your studies, you must cease on-campus employment. However, you may be eligible for authorization to remain in the United States and engage in paid practical training.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2183" src="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jeswin-thomas-hgJu2ykh4E-unsplash-300x195.webp" alt="working on a student visa" width="1103" height="717" srcset="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jeswin-thomas-hgJu2ykh4E-unsplash-300x195.webp 300w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jeswin-thomas-hgJu2ykh4E-unsplash-1024x665.webp 1024w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jeswin-thomas-hgJu2ykh4E-unsplash-768x499.webp 768w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jeswin-thomas-hgJu2ykh4E-unsplash-1536x998.webp 1536w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jeswin-thomas-hgJu2ykh4E-unsplash-2048x1331.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1103px) 100vw, 1103px" /></p><h2>Working Off-Campus Due to Severe Economic Hardship</h2><p>Despite your best efforts to maintain financial independence, unexpected circumstances can arise. Perhaps a parent loses a job, a scholarship foundation faces bankruptcy, currency devaluation occurs, tuition costs escalate, or a natural disaster strikes your home country.</p><p>Fortunately, US immigration laws offer provisions for such situations. If you demonstrate that unforeseen circumstances beyond your control have led to severe economic hardship, you may be eligible for <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">permission to work off-campus</span> for an external employer.</p><p>The process becomes simpler in cases where a significant event impacts your entire country, leading the US government to invoke the <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">Special Student Relief (SSR) program</span> and temporarily relax some regulations for all qualified applicants from your country.</p><p>While you&#8217;ll still need a permit for working on a student visa and prove your hardship, demonstrating the cause of hardship becomes less burdensome under SSR designation.</p><p>If you&#8217;ve been studying for less than a year, you&#8217;re typically responsible for navigating such challenges independently unless covered under an SSR designation that waives this requirement.</p><p>In such cases, you won&#8217;t qualify for special work authorization and may need to explore alternative means to cover expenses. Returning home and considering reapplying for a student visa later might be your only option.</p><p>For students who have completed a <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">full academic year</span>, maintain good academic standing, and cannot secure suitable on-campus employment to meet their financial needs, applying to the USCIS for off-campus work authorization is an option.</p><p>Even if currently employed on-campus, switching to off-campus work is permissible, especially if it offers better pay.</p><p>Work hours are limited to <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">20 per week during the academic term</span> but can extend to full-time during school breaks or vacations.</p><p>if you want to know the answer of <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://abroadin.com/blog/why-study-in-the-usa/">Why Study in the USA</a></span> read this article:</p><p><div class="jupiterx-oembed"><blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="a7eFcrLXac"><a href="https://abroadin.com/blog/why-study-in-the-usa/">Why Study in the USA | 7 Reasons to Pack Your Bags Today!</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Why Study in the USA | 7 Reasons to Pack Your Bags Today!&#8221; &#8212; Abroadin " src="https://abroadin.com/blog/why-study-in-the-usa/embed/#?secret=3l29HzyFRN#?secret=a7eFcrLXac" data-secret="a7eFcrLXac" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></p><h3>How to Apply for Off-Campus Work?</h3><p>To <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">apply for off-campus</span> work authorization, you must complete <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">USCIS Form I-765</span>. Your eligibility category for<span style="background-color: #99ccff;"> Question 29</span> will <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">be (c)(3)(iii)</span>. This application necessitates a comprehensive array of documentation, including:</p><ul><li>Copies of any previous work permit you&#8217;ve obtained, front and back.</li><li>Two photos, akin to US passport style, with your name written in pencil on the back.</li><li>Supporting documents demonstrating economic need, such as news articles outlining the economic situation in your home country, affidavits from individuals supporting you, a copy of a termination letter from your family or sponsor&#8217;s employment, or copies of medical bills.</li><li>A sworn statement outlining the reasons for needing work authorization and explaining why alternative employment options, such as on-campus work, are unavailable.</li><li>Copies of the identity and visa pages from your passport.</li><li>The required fee is $410 until March 31, then increases to $420 for online submissions and $475 for paper filings.</li></ul><p>Seek assistance from your DSO throughout the application process for working on a student visa.</p><p>If applying under the SSR program, your <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">DSO</span> must certify separately in the <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">SEVIS</span> that you meet all <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">SSR qualifying criteria</span>. Subsequently, follow the instructions on the USCIS website to submit your application.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2182" src="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/unseen-studio-s9CC2SKySJM-unsplash-300x200.webp" alt="working on a student visa" width="1051" height="700" srcset="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/unseen-studio-s9CC2SKySJM-unsplash-300x200.webp 300w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/unseen-studio-s9CC2SKySJM-unsplash-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/unseen-studio-s9CC2SKySJM-unsplash-768x512.webp 768w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/unseen-studio-s9CC2SKySJM-unsplash-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/unseen-studio-s9CC2SKySJM-unsplash-2048x1365.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1051px) 100vw, 1051px" /></p><h2>Curricular Practical Training for F-1 Students</h2><p>Curricular practical training entails off-campus work that is integral to your curriculum and directly aligned with your major study area.</p><p>If your academic program includes such opportunities as cooperative education or internship programs, you may pursue these positions. Compensation for this work may vary.</p><p>For instance, if you&#8217;re studying psychology and your program mandates you to gain credit or fulfill graduation requirements by working at a facility or hospital, this would qualify as curricular practical training.</p><p>Even if the work<span style="background-color: #99ccff;"> isn&#8217;t obligatory</span>, if it&#8217;s listed as &#8220;elective&#8221; in the school&#8217;s catalog, overseen by a faculty member, and offers academic credit, it could qualify as curricular practical training.</p><p>Curricular practical training is available to students who have completed at least <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">one academic year</span> at the college level or higher. An exception exists for graduate programs that necessitate immediate participation in such training.</p><p>Engaging in one year of full-time practical training during your studies will render you <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">ineligible</span> for further practical training post-completion.</p><p>It may result in forfeiting the opportunity to spend additional time in the United States post-graduation. To circumvent this issue, opt for less than one year of curricular practical training or ensure your participation is part-time rather than full-time.</p><p>For curricular practical training, you do not require prior permission from USCIS. The only procedural steps for working on a student visa involve your DSO:</p><ul><li>Approving your proposed plan</li><li>Reporting your authorization for curricular practical training to SEVIS</li><li>Endorsing your SEVIS I-20 to reflect this approval.</li></ul><p>Under this process, you&#8217;ll be authorized for the duration outlined in your curricular practical training plan. The approved dates will be indicated on your<span style="background-color: #99ccff;"> I-20 form</span>.</p><p>Unlike other off-campus work arrangements, you won&#8217;t need a separate work permit card, an <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">&#8220;employment authorization document&#8221;</span> or<span style="background-color: #99ccff;"> &#8220;EAD.&#8221;</span></p><p>if you need more information about <a href="https://abroadin.com/blog/us-student-visa-for-indian-students-conditions-and-requirements-for-2024/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">US Student Visa for Indian Students</span></a> read this article:</p><p><div class="jupiterx-oembed"><blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UT3ScIbcQn"><a href="https://abroadin.com/blog/us-student-visa-for-indian-students-conditions-and-requirements-for-2024/">US Student Visa for Indian Students + Conditions and Requirements for 2024</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;US Student Visa for Indian Students + Conditions and Requirements for 2024&#8221; &#8212; Abroadin " src="https://abroadin.com/blog/us-student-visa-for-indian-students-conditions-and-requirements-for-2024/embed/#?secret=MgfE3FgLX7#?secret=UT3ScIbcQn" data-secret="UT3ScIbcQn" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></p><h2>Optional Practical Training for F-1 Students</h2><p><span style="background-color: #99ccff;">Optional practical training (OPT)</span> provides another avenue for off-campus work for F-1 students. Unlike curricular practical training, OPT doesn&#8217;t need to be a specific part of the <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">university&#8217;s offerings</span>. However, it must be related to your studies and directly tied to your major.</p><p>The work you undertake during OPT must align with your field of study. For instance, working at a coffee shop while enrolled in a nursing program wouldn&#8217;t meet USCIS requirements. The training must be relevant to your major and commensurate with your educational level.</p><p>Unlike curricular practical training, you&#8217;ll need a work permit card and an <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">&#8220;employment authorization document&#8221; (EAD)</span>, which you&#8217;ll apply for using <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">USCIS Form I-765.</span> Your eligibility category is <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">(c)(3)(A)</span> if you haven&#8217;t completed your studies yet and <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">(c)(3)(B)</span> if you have.</p><p>OPT is available only to students who have completed at least one academic year at the college level or higher. The maximum duration for full-time OPT is one year. Part-time employment is permissible before program completion, with hours deducted from the one-year maximum at half the rate.</p><p>You can undertake OPT while school is in session <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">(for 20 hours a week or less)</span>, during breaks, after meeting degree requirements, or after graduation, as long as the training period concludes within 14 months.</p><p>Work can be full-time or part-time before program completion, but must be full-time after. Be mindful not to exhaust your OPT prematurely. Engaging in one or more years of full-time practical training during your studies will render you ineligible for further practical training post-graduation.</p><p>If you completed a degree in science, technology, engineering, or math, you&#8217;re eligible for a <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">24-month extension</span> of your OPT, commonly known as a <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">STEM extension</span>.</p><p>F-1 students pursuing STEM OPT extensions may work for new start-up businesses, provided all regulatory requirements of working on a student visa are met.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>This Abroadin article covered many tips and points about working on a student visa for international students.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Australia, Cost of Studying Abroad for Indian Students</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The quality of education, diverse culture, and beautiful landscapes make Australia an attractive and worthwhile choice for international students.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In 2023, India was Australia&#8217;s second-largest source country for international student enrollments, with over 95,000 Indian students pursuing their studies across various universities and institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Although the cost of living in Australia tends to be higher, the overall expenses for studying in Australia remain more budget-friendly compared to the USA, UK, and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">These are some estimations about the cost of studying in Australia for Indian students:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Pre-arrival costs, including airfare, exams, college applications, and visa charges, are approximately 162,000 rupees.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To ease study costs, international students can explore various scholarships like the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">ANU Chancellor’s International Scholarship,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Gates Cambridge Scholarships,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">UNSW’s Future of Change Scholarship,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">and UWA&#8217;s Global Excellence Scholarship.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The Australian student visa allows part-time work, offering students valuable experience, though income for amounts exceeding 1,000,000 rupees is taxable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Canada, Studying Abroad Expenses for Indian Students</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In 2023, India was Canada&#8217;s most significant source country for international student enrollments, with over 226,000 Indian students pursuing their studies across various institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A significant portion of the overall cost of studying in Canada is attributed to tuition fees at Canadian universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The specific amount of tuition varies based on the type of qualification and the institution an applicant selects for their studies in Canada.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Beyond tuition fees, expenses fluctuate based on the institution, chosen program, and individual lifestyle.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Pre-arrival costs, including tests, registration fees, and flight tickets, should be considered, along with purchasing a Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) and study permit expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">When selecting a college, students can estimate tuition fees, witnessing a 4.9% increase in the average. With varying costs across provinces, understanding the province-based tuition fees aids in making informed choices.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">In Germany, many government universities provide education for free, no matter where you&#8217;re from. It makes it one of the most affordable places to study in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">But, there might be some fees when you apply, and if you&#8217;re going for a Master&#8217;s degree without finishing your bachelor&#8217;s in Germany, you might have to pay tuition fees.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Finding Job in Europe after Graduation</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Graduating from a higher education program in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA) can open doors to exciting possibilities for international students.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">These opportunities vary from country to country, offering non-EU/EEA graduates a chance to stay and explore their host country&#8217;s job market.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Let us check out some of these options for finding job in Europe after graduation:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Temporary stay durations: Upon completing their studies, non-EU/EEA graduates often receive the opportunity to remain in their host country for a specified period. The duration of this stay varies widely across EU countries. For instance, Denmark extends this privilege for up to six months, while Germany offers an extended window of up to 18 months.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Visa extensions and residence permits: The mechanisms for facilitating this transition also differ. This opportunity is seamlessly integrated into the student residence visa extension in some EU nations. In some other countries, non-EU/EEA graduates may need to obtain a separate temporary residence permit.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Dedicated job search permits: Some EU countries take the concept a step further by introducing dedicated job search permits. These permits facilitate the pursuit of employment, streamlining the process for graduates eager to land their dream job in a foreign land.</span></li>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Extending Your Visa for Job Hunting</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You may need to apply for a visa extension in many EU countries to explore job opportunities. It is a crucial phase in your post-graduation plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here is what you need to know without checking unnecessary details:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Visa extension essentials: In several EU Member States, securing a job-seeking visa extension is a prerequisite for your post-graduation job hunt. Timing is critical here. To avoid disruptions in your stay, ensure that you initiate this process well in advance, ideally, before your study residence permit expires. This proactive approach prevents last-minute stress and complications.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Seeking guidance: Your higher education institution, where you completed your studies, can be a valuable resource in this step. They might offer guidance for the visa extension process, easing your transition into the next chapter of your life. Consider it as seeking advice from a trusted mentor; their expertise can prove invaluable.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Stay informed: Remember that visa regulations can change, and you are responsible for staying informed about the latest updates. Regularly checking official sources and being proactive in understanding the conditions for visa extensions ensures a smoother process.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Securing a job offer is critical to unlocking longer-term work opportunities in the European Union. If you do this, you may become eligible to pursue options like the EU Blue Card or other extended residence permits under each country&#8217;s regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">These longer-term permits grant you the stability and flexibility to work and thrive in your chosen destination.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">They signify a more profound commitment to your professional journey on European soil, ensuring that your career aspirations align seamlessly with the continent&#8217;s dynamic opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">So, remember, your job offer is not just a doorway but also a pathway to your future in the European Union.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Is it Possible to Work and Study Abroad?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">There are many opportunities to work while studying abroad. However, it is essential to be aware of each country&#8217;s specific requirements and procedures.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Health Insurance for Students in Canada</span></h2>
<p>International students must have health insurance when they are studying in Canada. Health care in Canada may cost students thousands of dollars per month if they do not have valid health insurance!</p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">How to Set up Health Insurance</span></h2>
<p>Suppose you started your program in September 2021 to August 2022 (2021/22 Winter Session to 2022 Summer Session) to have health insurance coverage. In that case, you must confirm your arrival date starting from 3 weeks before you travel.</p>
<p>Here is step-by-step guidance on health insurance and the cost of student insurance in Canada for international students:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Firstly Check Cost of Student Insurance</span></h3>
<p>After registering for the course, log into your SSC (Student Services Centre) and select “Financial Summary” under Finances to check the cost of student insurance and related charges. Confirm charging for iMED coverage and AMS/GSS Health and Dental Plan charges. If you are charged, then you are covered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Secondly, Confirm iMED Coverage Dates.</span></h3>
<p>If you started the course between September 2021 and August 2022, you have to confirm the exact arriving time to be covered, starting from 3 weeks before arriving time. If you start your studies in September 2022 or after that, you should change your coverage dates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Then Download and Print iMED Card.</span></h3>
<p>They send your iMED card through email. When you receive the email, download the card and print it correctly to present it when arriving in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Apply for the University MSP</span></h3>
<p>As soon as arriving at your university, apply for MSP (Medical Services Plan)</p>
<p>for yourself and family members who accompany you.</p>
<p>Each time you prolong your study permit or receive a post-graduation Work Permit, you must extend your MSP to secure insurance coverage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Download and Print AMS/GSS Health and Dental Plan Pay Direct Card</span></h3>
<p>Your Pay Direct card provides your claim to be prepared when you fill a prescription. You may charge a lower cost of student insurance if you use this plan when you study in Canadian universities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">What is iMED Program + Cost of Student Insurance</span></h2>
<p>The iMED is temporary private health insurance to cover international students while waiting to be eligible for the MSP. The Medical Services Plan has a three-month waiting period, so students have to get coverage during this time.</p>
<p>The time covers the following needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doctor visits,</li>
<li>Hospital visits,</li>
<li>Maternity coverage,</li>
<li>Ambulance services,</li>
<li>Pre-existing conditions,</li>
<li>Diagnostic, x-ray, and laboratory services.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are an exchange student for one semester or a VIRS student, you will have iMED for the duration of your <a href="https://abroadin.com/blog/short-term-study-abroad-programs-in-canada/">education in Canada.</a></p>
<p>If you have MSP or another Canadian territorial or provincial health plan or a third-party organization is funding your courses, you could qualify to opt out of iMED.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">The iMED Coverage Period</span></h2>
<p>After registering for the course, if the program started between September 2021 and August 2022, you would have received an email from DCIS (David Cummings Insurance Services) requesting confirmation of your arrival in Canada.</p>
<p>You have to confirm when you will travel with DCIS starting from 3 weeks before arriving in Canada so that your coverage time starts as soon as you arrive in Canada.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your program starts in 2022/22 winter semester (September to December 2022), your coverage begins on August 1, 2022;</li>
<li>If your program starts in 2022/23 winter semester (January to April 2023), your coverage begins on December 1, 2022;</li>
<li>If you are an exchange student for one semester or a VIRS student, you have the iMED coverage for the duration of your course;</li>
<li>If you arrive the month before or after your coverage starts, you can request to change coverage dates.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Cost of Student Insurance and iMED Fees</span></h2>
<p>Effective 2021/22 winter semester, September 1, 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>About $225 for three months,</li>
<li>About $315 for one-term exchange students.</li>
</ul>
<p>Effective 2022 summer semester, May 1, 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>About $10 for a one-time direct billing fee.</li>
</ul>
<p>These fees are charged to the SSC (Student Service Centre) account. Remember that the fees and cost of student insurance are subject to change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Eligibility for Health Insurance in Canada</span></h2>
<p>You are automatically registered in iMED as a new international university student when you enroll in classes. In your Student Services Centre account, check the Financial Summary page to make sure you were charged the fee and will be registered in the course.</p>
<p>If you are a returning university student, you are not qualified for iMED and can purchase private insurance, such as the GCHP (Global Campus Health Plan).</p>
<p>If you think you should have coverage for iMED but do not see the fees on your account, contact ISA (International Student Advising).</p>
<ul>
<li>If your program started between September 2021 and August 2022, you would have received an email from DCIS requesting approval of your arrival to Canada after you registered for classes. You must confirm your arrival date starting three weeks before you move. After verifying your arrival date, they send your iMED card through email. Make sure to print a copy for yourself.</li>
<li>If your program begins September 2021 or later, they send you an iMED card via email. Make sure to print a copy of it for yourself.</li>
<li>If you do not get your card, contact David Cummings Insurance Services.</li>
<li>Verify that the iMED coverage time on your iMED card is correct. iMED coverage should begin from the month you move to Canada plus two months to cover the MSP waiting period or cover the whole duration of your studies program if you are a one-term exchange student or VIRS student.</li>
<li>If you have any family members accompanying you, you have to add them to iMED too.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>The approximate cost of student insurance in Canada starting from September 2021 is around $265 for one year, and starting from January 2022 is around: $177 for eight months. If the international students have any accompanying family members, they are also responsible for adding them to the plan. Read this article for more information.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">7 Things to Remember When Taking Education Loans for Study Abroad</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"> When applying for education loans for study abroad as a student from India, there are some critical points to follow to accomplish your goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">These are seven things shared by Indian students who already got their loans:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">1. Moratorium Period</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is when the borrower need not make any repayment to the bank. This period varies from bank to bank and could last up to some time after completing the course.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">2. The Margin of Loans for Study Abroad</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Usually, banks do not provide the total amount needed to fund education. Most public banks issue 90% of the total amount, and the remaining 10% has to be arranged by the applicant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">3. Effect of Exchange Rate</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Always calculate the amount you will receive at the time of disbursement, as any change in the rate may affect the applicant’s amount.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">4. Collateral Rules of Loans for Study Abroad</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Whether movable or immovable, any property can be offered to a bank as a security for a loan is collateral. Most Indian banks demand collateral as security to reduce the risk involved in paying off the credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Any liquid assets like bonds, FD, shares, or immovable property like the house, commercial property, or just land can be classified as collateral.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">One crucial point to remember is that banks don’t accept agricultural land as collateral.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Bonds, deposits, shares, mutual fund units, gold, debentures, bank deposits, life insurance policy, and government securities, are accepted as collateral.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;">5. Guarantor Responsibilities</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Becoming a loan guarantor is a great responsibility as the guarantor will have a legal obligation to pay if the borrower doesn’t. If the loan amount surpasses INR 4 lakhs, the bank may ask for a guarantee from a third party.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If the borrower cannot repay the loan amount irrespective of the circumstances, in that case, the guarantor holds the liability to reimburse the entire amount to banks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">6. Read the Agreement Carefully</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is one of the most important aspects to look after while taking a loan. It’s always best to go through the terms and conditions of the loan carefully and then move ahead with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">We stress it upon one factor, as you should always be transparent with all the requirements mentioned in the loan agreement. If you have any uncertainties, consult the experts apart from the bank representative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">7. The Maximum Loan Amount</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The banks set no limit for offering education loans to students abroad. It depends on the bank to bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The majority of the banks provide loans maximum up to INR 20 to 30 lakhs. Also, if the loan is more than INR 20 lakhs, then the interest rate increases respectively.</span></p>
