<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Australia, Cost of Studying Abroad for Indian Students</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The quality of education, diverse culture, and beautiful landscapes make Australia an attractive and worthwhile choice for international students.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In 2023, India was Australia&#8217;s second-largest source country for international student enrollments, with over 95,000 Indian students pursuing their studies across various universities and institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Although the cost of living in Australia tends to be higher, the overall expenses for studying in Australia remain more budget-friendly compared to the USA, UK, and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">These are some estimations about the cost of studying in Australia for Indian students:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Pre-arrival costs, including airfare, exams, college applications, and visa charges, are approximately 162,000 rupees.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To ease study costs, international students can explore various scholarships like the following:</span></p>

<li><span style="color: #333333;">Gates Cambridge Scholarships,</span></li>

<li><span style="color: #333333;">and UWA&#8217;s Global Excellence Scholarship.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The Australian student visa allows part-time work, offering students valuable experience, though income for amounts exceeding 1,000,000 rupees is taxable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Canada, Studying Abroad Expenses for Indian Students</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In 2023, India was Canada&#8217;s most significant source country for international student enrollments, with over 226,000 Indian students pursuing their studies across various institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A significant portion of the overall cost of studying in Canada is attributed to tuition fees at Canadian universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The specific amount of tuition varies based on the type of qualification and the institution an applicant selects for their studies in Canada.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Beyond tuition fees, expenses fluctuate based on the institution, chosen program, and individual lifestyle.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">But, there might be some fees when you apply, and if you&#8217;re going for a Master&#8217;s degree without finishing your bachelor&#8217;s in Germany, you might have to pay tuition fees.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">7 Things to Remember When Taking Education Loans for Study Abroad</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"> When applying for education loans for study abroad as a student from India, there are some critical points to follow to accomplish your goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">These are seven things shared by Indian students who already got their loans:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">1. Moratorium Period</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is when the borrower need not make any repayment to the bank. This period varies from bank to bank and could last up to some time after completing the course.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">2. The Margin of Loans for Study Abroad</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Usually, banks do not provide the total amount needed to fund education. Most public banks issue 90% of the total amount, and the remaining 10% has to be arranged by the applicant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">3. Effect of Exchange Rate</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Always calculate the amount you will receive at the time of disbursement, as any change in the rate may affect the applicant’s amount.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">4. Collateral Rules of Loans for Study Abroad</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Whether movable or immovable, any property can be offered to a bank as a security for a loan is collateral. Most Indian banks demand collateral as security to reduce the risk involved in paying off the credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Any liquid assets like bonds, FD, shares, or immovable property like the house, commercial property, or just land can be classified as collateral.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">One crucial point to remember is that banks don’t accept agricultural land as collateral.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Bonds, deposits, shares, mutual fund units, gold, debentures, bank deposits, life insurance policy, and government securities, are accepted as collateral.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">5. Guarantor Responsibilities</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Becoming a loan guarantor is a great responsibility as the guarantor will have a legal obligation to pay if the borrower doesn’t. If the loan amount surpasses INR 4 lakhs, the bank may ask for a guarantee from a third party.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If the borrower cannot repay the loan amount irrespective of the circumstances, in that case, the guarantor holds the liability to reimburse the entire amount to banks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">6. Read the Agreement Carefully</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is one of the most important aspects to look after while taking a loan. It’s always best to go through the terms and conditions of the loan carefully and then move ahead with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">We stress it upon one factor, as you should always be transparent with all the requirements mentioned in the loan agreement. If you have any uncertainties, consult the experts apart from the bank representative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">7. The Maximum Loan Amount</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The banks set no limit for offering education loans to students abroad. It depends on the bank to bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The majority of the banks provide loans maximum up to INR 20 to 30 lakhs. Also, if the loan is more than INR 20 lakhs, then the interest rate increases respectively.</span></p>
