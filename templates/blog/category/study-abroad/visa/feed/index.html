</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">US Student Visa for Indian Students</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">India is the second-most common country from which many students come to study or work in the United States. Most of the students from India, around 94,000, want to study at the graduate level after completing their first degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The next big group is students doing an OPT internship (Optional Practical Training). These students might still be studying at their American university or have just finished their studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Most Indian students who go to the US, around 80%, are interested in subjects like science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM). Only a small group, about 10%, come to study business.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The states that attract the most international students, including those from India, are California, Massachusetts, New York, Illinois, Texas, and Pennsylvania. These states have more than 50,000 students from different countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although the US Department of State doesn&#8217;t share the exact number of visa applications or how many were declined, they mention that more than 816,000 visas were given by US embassies and consulates in India in 2019.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">What is the USA Study Visa Process?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Getting US student visa for Indian students is relatively easy, but following all the requirements and giving yourself enough time for paperwork is essential.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Before applying for your F-1 student visa, ensure you&#8217;ve been accepted into a recognized US college or university degree program.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are two types of student visas for Indian students going to the USA: F-1 and M-1. If you&#8217;re taking academic courses at a recognized institution for a degree, you&#8217;ll need an F-1 visa. For vocational or nonacademic classes, an M-1 visa is required. It includes university, high school, language training, and more programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Applying for your USA student visa online is straightforward. Follow these steps for the USA study visa process in 2024:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Complete the online non-immigrant visa application with form DS-160.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Upload a photograph within the specified size limit.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Fill in the required details, upload documents, and submit the application.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Print the application form for your visa interview.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Schedule a visa interview at your nearest US Consulate or Embassy. Applying from a different country may be challenging.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Pay the non-refundable student visa application fee of USD 160.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Pay the one-time SEVIS fee for F-1, J-1, or M-1 status.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Gather all necessary documents for the interview.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Attend the interview.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The time for USA study visa process varies, usually taking three to five weeks on average. Applying early allows ample processing time and the opportunity to correct mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once accepted, the Consulate will deliver documents of US student visa for Indian students in approximately two working days.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">While international F-1 visa holders are not legally obligated to possess international medical or health insurance, it is advisable for peace of mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Additionally, many universities in the US mandate an active insurance plan before allowing enrollment in classes.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">What are the USA Study Visa Requirements?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You might have to wait between 12 days (in Chennai/Madras) and 36 days (in Hyderabad) to meet the interview of US student visa for Indian students.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Wait times can change, so booking your US visa appointment early is essential. The expected wait times are on the US Department of State website.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">These are the most important USA study visa requirements and documents you have to provide for your visa interview:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A Valid passport</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Passport-size photos</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">DS-160 and I-901 SEVIS payment confirmation pages</span></li>

<li><span style="color: #000000;">Application fee payment receipt</span></li>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you need more clarification about applying for a study visa to the USA from India, you can schedule your interview at various US consulates and embassies in India.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To locate your nearest US embassy, check the links below for the US embassy and consulates in India:</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">If your student visa expires before your study program concludes, you can renew it following a process similar to applying for a new visa.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, additional documents may be required, such as a photo of your visa and supporting documents from your university.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Scholarships and US Student Visa for Indian Students</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you&#8217;re an outstanding student, you can apply for scholarships at the institute or university you&#8217;re interested in. Scholarships are a great way to fund your education, and there are various options for studying in the US.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">These scholarships, offered by universities, can be need-based or merit-based. Indian students should explore different scholarship opportunities. Here are some popular ones:</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Can International Students Work while Studying in the US?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As an F-1 visa holder primarily meant for full-time students, working in the United States is generally not allowed. However, there are exceptions, particularly for internships and work related to your studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The permitted employment paths for international students include Optional Practical Training (OPT) or Curricular Practical Training (CPT), on-campus employment, and severe economic hardship cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To explore work opportunities on an F-1 visa, it&#8217;s essential to consult with your Designated School Official (DSO) for approval and guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In April 2008, the Department of Homeland Security changed the rules for OPT (Optional Practical Training) for students in specific degree programs. They allowed an extension of 17 months for OPT, making it 29 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The reason was to fill the time gap for students who finished their OPT and didn&#8217;t have a chance to apply for an H1B visa because of certain time limits and visa restrictions. This extension gives students more time to apply for an H1B visa.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, this extension is only for students working with companies enrolled in the E-Verify program. It applies to subjects like Actuarial Science, Computer Science Applications, Engineering, Life Sciences, Mathematics, Military Technologies, and Physical Sciences.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A complete list of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) Designated Degree Programs is available for those who qualify for this extension.</span></p>

<li><span style="color: #333333;">Conclusion</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">What can Indian Students do with a German Student Visa?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Suppose you have been accepted to study at a German university, recognized institution, university of Applied Sciences, college of Arts and Music, or a similar higher education institution. In that case, you can apply for a German student visa.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This German student visa for Indian students is for full-time university studies or preparatory courses, like foundation courses.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">With a German student visa, you have an initial 3-month stay in Germany. During this period, you must apply for a residence permit to study. This permit can last up to two years, and you can extend it based on the duration of your studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here are the types of studies you can pursue with a German student visa:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Full-time academic studies.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">German language courses for studies.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Propaedeutic course.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Mandatory preliminary internship.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">State preparatory college &#8216;Studienkolleg&#8217;: This is for foreigners whose school-leaving certificate is not recognized in Germany. After completing the course, you&#8217;ll take the &#8220;Feststellungsprüfung&#8221; test. Passing this test gives you a university entrance qualification certificate, allowing you to apply for university admission in Germany.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In addition, Indian students can do the following activities having a German student visa:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Extend Visa: Apply for an extension of the student residence permit if you still need to finish your planned studies within the visa period and complete them reasonably.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Part-Time Job: Work part-time for up to 120 working days per year. It includes working part-time in an academic institution where you are studying. However, your work should be fine with your study progress.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Residence Permit for Job-Seeking: Apply for a residence permit for job-seeking after graduation. It is available if you&#8217;ve completed your studies in Germany. With this permit, you can search for a job or become self-employed for up to 6 months after graduation. You may also take temporary jobs while looking for a permanent job related to your academic qualification.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">However, there are things you may not do with such a visa:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Full-Time Job: You cannot engage in a full-time job that requires 240 working days per year. While you&#8217;re a student, you do not qualify to apply for a work permit for a full-time job.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Abandon Study: You must continue study lessons. Participate in study lessons to avoid the cancellation of your eligibility to remain in Germany.</span></li>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">How much are Visa Fees and Bank Balance for German Student Visa?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Indian students applying for a <a href="https://www.mygermanuniversity.com/articles/Student-Visa-Germany-From-India#:~:text=Depending%20on%20the%20individual%20cases%20(largely%20on%20the%20residence%20and,in%20Mumbai%2C%20German%20Consulate%20in">German student visa</a> are required to pay fees based on their age:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Applicants under 18 years old: INR 3420</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Applicants over 18 years old: INR 6840</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The German Embassy/Consulate requires Indian students to deposit INR 10 lakh into a blocked bank account when applying for a student visa to Germany.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You may get a German student visa without a blocked account, too. However, you should meet one of these conditions:</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you can&#8217;t fulfill these requirements, having a blocked account becomes a mandatory prerequisite for obtaining a German student visa for Indian students to study in Germany.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">What are the Steps to Apply for a German Student Visa for Indian Students?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here is a simplified step-by-step guide for Indian students applying for a German student visa:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Step 1: Open a Blocked Bank Account</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Open a blocked bank account to show proof of financial resources. You can do this online through approved providers like Expatrio or the Indian branch of a valid German bank.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Step 2: Complete the Visa Application Form</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Fill out the &#8220;Application for a National Visa&#8221; form online or download and complete a PDF copy from the German Mission in India. Have your ID card and passport ready.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Step 3: Take Biometric Visa Pictures</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Take passport-size pictures with a white background and 35mm x 45mm dimensions. Most photo studios in major Indian cities are familiar with German visa photo requirements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Step 4: Collect Required Documents</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Gather all required documents on the &#8220;Checklist for a German national visa – student.&#8221; Download and submit a copy of the checklist with your date and signature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Step 5: Make an Appointment with the German Embassy</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Schedule an appointment with the German Mission in India responsible for your jurisdiction. It can be done online or through VFS Global.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Step 6: Get a Visa Fee Demand Draft</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Pay the visa fee through a Demand Draft at the end of your visa appointment. German Missions accept Demand Drafts from all nationalized banks in India.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Step 7: Submit the Application, Attend the Interview, and Pay the Visa Fee</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Attend your appointment on time with all necessary documents. Participate in a visa interview with an Embassy/Consulate officer who will ask about your trip and study plans. Pay the visa fee at the end of the appointment.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2082" src="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/visa-application-different-countries-arrangement.jpg" alt="german student visa for indian students" width="821" height="548" srcset="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/visa-application-different-countries-arrangement.jpg 821w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/visa-application-different-countries-arrangement-300x200.jpg 300w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/visa-application-different-countries-arrangement-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 821px) 100vw, 821px" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">How Long Does It Take to Issue German Student Visa?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">After the visa interview, the processing time for a decision from the Embassy/Consulate in India typically ranges from 15 to 30 working days.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">However, this duration may vary depending on the Embassy&#8217;s workload and whether additional documents are required.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It&#8217;s worth noting that some Indian students, as shared on online forums, have reported waiting periods of four to six weeks, and sometimes even up to 12 weeks, to receive a decision on their visa.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Once you have obtained your student visa, you can <a href="https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/india/germany/student-visa/#:~:text=The%20German%20student%20visa%20fee,Republic%20of%20Germany%2C%20New%20Delhi">travel to Germany</a>. You can apply for a student residence permit at the Foreigners&#8217; Registration Office upon arrival. This additional permit is necessary to reside in Germany for your studies legally.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">What should Students do upon coming to Germany?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Before starting your studies in Germany, there are several essential steps to follow:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Firstly, secure permanent accommodation in Germany, whether it&#8217;s a student residence, shared flat, or a rented apartment. Having proof of a permanent address will be crucial for various future requirements.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Next, ensure you have health insurance coverage through a German health insurance policy. It is mandatory for everyone residing in Germany.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Enroll in studies to obtain the certificate of enrollment. Graduate at the student service office during the specified enrollment period mentioned in your admission letter. The certificate of enrollment is essential for address registration, residence permit applications, and obtaining discounts.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">To enroll at a German university as an Indian, you&#8217;ll need a valid national passport with a valid student visa, a letter of admission, recent passport photographs, and student health insurance.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">The next step is opening a current bank account with a recognized German bank. This account will be used for various payments, including rent, study fees, registration fees, and other bills. It&#8217;s also necessary to receive subsidies or your salary.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Register your living address at the Resident&#8217;s Registration Office or Citizen&#8217;s Bureau within one week of finding permanent housing. Upon completion of the application, you&#8217;ll receive a confirmation of registration.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Finally, apply for a residence permit for your studies at the Foreigners&#8217; Registration Office once you have the registration confirmation. It should be done while holding a valid German student visa for Indian students in 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is a complete guide to getting a German student visa for Indian students in 2024.

<li><span style="color: #333333;">What are the most Common Reasons for Canada Student Visa Rejection?</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">How to Decrease the Chances of Canada Student Visa Rejection?</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Conclusion</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">What does Canada Student Visa Refusal mean?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A study found that many employers all over the world are willing to pay higher salaries to students studying abroad.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is why millions of students worldwide travel to other countries to earn their degrees, and make a new path for the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Canada is one of the most popular study destinations, offering various advanced and high-quality education programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">International students need to obtain a study permit and a <a href="https://www.canadim.com/blog/5-reasons-study-permit-application-refused/#:~:text=If%20you%20don't%20have,or%20criminally%20inadmissible%20to%20Canada.">Canadian student visa</a> to study in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The application process can be initiated after being accepted to a DLI (Designated Learning Institute).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">According to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), over 640,000 international students are holding student visas in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The number of student visa applications has been increasing every year, and so has the number of rejections. Around 30% of student visa applications are rejected each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">There are many reasons for Canada student visa rejection. International students should be aware of these reasons and take steps to avoid them to increase their chances of success.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here are some of the most common reasons for Canadian student visa rejection cases:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Lack of financial support</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Inadequate language proficiency</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Failure to provide complete documentation</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Having a criminal record in the home country</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Lack of enough ties to home country</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Unclear intention to return home after graduation</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">International students planning to study in Canada should carefully review the requirements for a student visa and ensure they meet all of the criteria.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">They should also be prepared to provide detailed and accurate information about their academic and financial background.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">By taking these steps, they can increase their chances of having their student visa application approved.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The increasing popularity of Canadian universities has led to a higher number of visa applications, which has, in turn, led to an increase in the number of rejections.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Even students with good academic records may be rejected due to the limited available academic spots.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To minimize the chances of refusal, students should understand the reasons behind a rejected visa application.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">What are the most Common Reasons for Canada Student Visa Rejection?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The following are some of the most common reasons for<a href="https://www.kanan.co/blog/reasons-for-canada-student-visa-rejection/"> Canada student visa refusal</a>, which you should consider and try to avoid to increase your chances.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">1. Financial Instability</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To be eligible for a Canadian student visa, immigration officers assess your financial independence and ability to pay for one year of tuition and living expenses at the college.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If they are satisfied that you can do so without going into debt or relying on their government assistance, they will grant you the intended visa.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">International students who successfully apply for Canadian student visas usually provide financial documentation showing they can support themselves in Canada for a specific amount of time without working.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">However, they often need to provide more documentation to show that they can afford to pay for one year of tuition at the college they are applying to.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The Canadian government expects international students to have the financial means to cover their tuition and other expenses, so they require credible evidence of financial stability.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To avoid this issue, you should provide proof of adequate finances for more than one year and any other relevant financial documentation, including bank statements, proof of employment, or a letter of financial support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">2. Inadequate Documents</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The Canada student visa rejection happens when the applicant needs a complete travel history or their identity documents need to be clarified.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If there are gaps in travel history, the visa officer looks at the travel records to see if there are any suspicious periods.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The visa authorities also check identification documents to determine if the applicant has any medical conditions or criminal convictions that would prevent them from being admitted to Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Additionally, the application may be denied if you stated on your study permit application form that you have previous travel experience but need more documentation to support this claim.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is essential to support travel history with adequate documentation and proof. The identity documents should be straightforward to understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To make it easy for the IRCC officer to understand your online application, arrange your scanned documents chronologically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">3. Poor Academic Performance</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Visa officers review your academic records to see if you have an excellent overall academic performance. Good grades are essential, but other factors will be considered.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Your English language proficiency test scores, such as IELTS and TOEFL, will also be necessary. If the academic records are inconsistent, this will be a red flag for the visa officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">International students should be prepared to explain any inconsistencies in their academic records with the help of a counselor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">4. Intent to Stay after Graduation</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A student visa is a temporary visa that expires after the international student completes their studies. So, visa officers want to ensure they return to their home country.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Some students may decide to stay in Canada after graduation because of limited opportunities in their home country. However, this could be why a student visa application is rejected.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To increase their chances of visa approval, international students should demonstrate their eagerness to return home after graduation in their application form and visa interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">They can do this by providing convincing documentation about the job opportunities and family ties in their home country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">5. Inconsistency with Work Experience</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you are applying for a student visa to study a program unrelated to your previous qualifications or work experience, the visa officer may hesitate to approve your application.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The visa officer wants to see that you are genuinely interested in the program and will likely succeed in your studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To increase your chances of visa approval, you should be able to explain why you are changing your field of interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You should also provide evidence to support your explanation, such as letters of recommendation from professors or employers or transcripts from previous courses.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Whatever you say or mention in your application should be backed up by valid proof. You should be able to provide documentation to support your claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">For example, say that you have a strong interest in studying medicine. You should be able to provide transcripts from science courses or letters of recommendation from science teachers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">6. Not Having a Letter of Acceptance</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A letter of acceptance from a DLI is required for all international students who want to study in Canada. The DLI is the school or university that you will be attending.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The acceptance letter confirms that you have been accepted to the program and meet the school&#8217;s requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In addition to the acceptance letter, you must provide proof of your financial resources and English language proficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You may also include any other supporting documents or statements that you believe will strengthen your application.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">7. Now, Proper Choice of Course</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The visa officers pay close attention to whether your chosen study program matches your future professional aspirations or your prior educational background.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">They will raise an issue if they notice that you are suddenly changing your field of interest or stream of study.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Common academic-related reasons for the rejection of a Canada student visa:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Applying for PG Diploma with very high GPA in Bachelors</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Applying for PG Diploma after Masters</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Career Gap</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Second Masters (non-MBA)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Program not aligned with prior education</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">There is no alternative to convince the visa officials that it at least signifies some worth to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You must include a thorough personal statement and other records about your academic background. If you are in a situation like this, remember that detailing is the key.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">What is the Canadian Study Permit</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The Canadian study permit is a document that allows international students to study at designated learning institutions (DLI) in Canada. Most international students need a student visa for Canada or a study permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You should make sure you have all the documents you need before starting to apply. Keep in mind that you should apply before you go to Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The study permit for Canada is not a visa. It doesn&#8217;t let you enter Canada. You should have a visitor visa or an electronic travel authorization (eTA) for entering this country. If the Canadian authorities approve your study permit, they will issue one with your study permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A study permit for Canada is usually valid for your study program&#8217;s length, plus 90 days. The 90 days let you plan to leave this country or apply to extend your stay there.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you leave Canada during your studies, you may need to show proof you&#8217;re registered in the intended institution when you return to Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you have electronic travel authorization (eTA) or a visitor visa, it must still be valid when you return to this country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">When to Apply for a Student Visa for Canada</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It&#8217;s better to apply for a student visa for Canada before coming to this country. If you determine to continue your education in another course, you&#8217;ll need to leave Canada and apply for a Canadian study permit through a visa office.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Once you have a study permit, you can apply to renew it from inside Canada if you want to continue your studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">For full-time students registered at an approved university, a study permit also allows you to work part-time on campus. You also can work off-campus, work as a co-op or intern as part of the program, stay in this country as a permanent or find work even after graduation.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">How to Apply for Canadian Study Permit in 6 steps</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You can apply for a study permit or student visa for Canada through a paper application or online, which you can obtain from the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) website.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Paper applications take about twice as long, and it&#8217;s always suggested to check the processing times in advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To apply online, you&#8217;ll need a credit card and the capability to create electronic copies of your approving documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The visa office in your country will present specific guidance about which documents you need to give; this can vary depending on your location. If you need help, you can go to your nearest visa application center (VAC).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The process for getting a student visa for Canada is as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">First, you should obtain a regulated letter of acceptance from a recognized higher education institution. Students studying in Quebec must also need a certificate of acceptance (CAQ) from Quebec&#8217;s government. It would help if you got this before you are permitted to apply for a student visa. You can get this by printing out an online form or requesting a paper form from your university.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Now, you should get a study permit application, either from the CIC website or by reaching your local visa office or the Canadian embassy. You may also need to get a temporary residence permit if you are from a selected country, but this will not confuse matters too much as they treat it simultaneously as your study permit application.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">To get your application package, you&#8217;ll need to answer a few questions about yourself on the CIC website. These questions will determine whether you can apply online for a student visa for Canada and what documents you should provide.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">If you are qualified, you will get a personal checklist code, valid for 60 days, which you will need to submit your study permit application online. Print out the page involving your code for future references. The page will include a guideline, an approximated tuition fees amount, and a list of documents to submit with your application.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">When you are ready, create an account on MyCIC to enter your checklist code. You will then receive your document checklist, which allows you to upload and send your documents to CIC.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Once you have your application form and documents ready and have paid your fees, you can submit your application to CIC. Some candidates may have to attend an interview at the visa office.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1596" src="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/visa-application-form-laptop-1.jpg" alt="student visa for canada" width="1095" height="730" srcset="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/visa-application-form-laptop-1.jpg 1095w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/visa-application-form-laptop-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/visa-application-form-laptop-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/visa-application-form-laptop-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1095px) 100vw, 1095px" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Other Requirements for Student Visa for Canada</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The following other requirements for a Canadian study permit may also apply:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Applicants from Africa, Europe, or the Middle East may need to provide photos and fingerprints.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Some candidates may also need to get a police check or medical exam before submitting their applications. You can&#8217;t get a student visa for Canada if you have a criminal record.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Unless you&#8217;re from the United States or St. Pierre and Miquelon, you have to confirm you have a legitimate passport that permits you to return to your country after finishing the program. Two passport-sized photos are also required, with your name and date of birth written on the back.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Requirements for a student visa for Canada also involve proof of funds to support yourself. It costs USD 7650 for every year, USD 8400 if you&#8217;re applying to study in Quebec. You will also need to have money for paying the transportation expense to return to your home country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To confirm you have enough money, you may give any of these documents:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Bank statements;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">A bank draft in a convertible currency;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Proof of paying tuition and accommodation costs;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">A letter from a person or institution that provides you money;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Confirmation of a Canadian account in your name if the money&#8217;s been transferred;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Proof of funding paid from inside Canada if you are undertaking a Canadian-funded program or you have scholarships.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">When the student visa for Canada application is approved, you&#8217;ll get a Port of Entry (POE) Letter of Introduction. International students from countries that require an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) or a temporary residence visa will be assigned these if needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The eTA will be connected to your passport. It would help if you traveled with the passport you used when you used it for your study permit. The eTA will be legitimate for five years or until your passport date expires.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Present these along with your passport, your letter of acceptance, and proof of your finances to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) in this country, who will then issue your student visa for Canada and allow you to enter this country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Applying through the Student Direct Stream</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Canada recently introduced the Student Direct Stream, in which students from China, India, the Philippines, or Vietnam can apply to get their student visa for Canada faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The requirements are similar to the general study permit. However, there are stricter language requirements. You need to have a 6 in IELTS or a 7 in the Niveaux the Compétence Linguistique Canadiens for French. You may also graduate from a Canadian-curriculum high school.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you don&#8217;t meet the Student Direct Stream requirements but meet them for the regular study permit, they review your application for the standard study permit option, and you won&#8217;t get faster processing.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Working while Studying in Canada</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Suppose you&#8217;d like to get a part-time job to help support yourself while studying in Canada. In that case, you can qualify to work on or off-campus for up to 20 hours during university terms and full-time during breaks or holidays, without a work permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To qualify, you must:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Be a full-time student;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Have a valid study permit;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Enroll at a designated learning institution at the post-secondary level or, in Quebec, a vocational program at the secondary level;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Study in an academic, vocational, or professional training program that leads to a degree, diploma, or certificate for at least six months.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You also need a SIN (Social Insurance Number) from Service Canada to work in this country or receive government programs&#8217; benefits and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Your student visa for Canada will become invalid 90 days after you have completed your study program, so you&#8217;ll need to acquire a post-graduation work permit if you want to stay in Canada after your studies and seek work. It is valid for three years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">For studying in Canada, you need a student visa for Canada or a study permit. However, if your university course lasts six months or less in this country, you do not need a study permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You can apply for a study permit or student visa for Canada either online or through a paper application. Read this step-by-step guide on how to get a student visa for Canada and its requirements for more information.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #333333;">Suppose you are an international student living and studying in the United States and considering staying in the country to work, further your studies. In that case, you may want to get a green card after graduation and be a lawful permanent resident. This article covers the most common US visas and then discusses how to change student visas to a green card for reaching permanent residence in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In this guide:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Common US Visas for International Students</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">F-1 Visa to Green Card | Green Card after Graduation</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Conclusion</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Common US Visas for International Students</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you want to stay in the United States after graduation, you should get a green card after graduation from your studies, but first, make sure that you know visa restrictions and requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Steering the immigration process in the US is often confusing because there are as many visa options. The eligibility requirements and regulations constantly change, making this process more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here are the most common options applicable to international students.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1529" src="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/student-plaid-skirt-holds-notebook-1.jpg" alt="green card after graduation" width="1344" height="896" srcset="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/student-plaid-skirt-holds-notebook-1.jpg 1344w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/student-plaid-skirt-holds-notebook-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/student-plaid-skirt-holds-notebook-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/student-plaid-skirt-holds-notebook-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1344px) 100vw, 1344px" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Practical Training on an F1 Visa | Green Card after Graduation</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">An F1 student is generally entitled to one year of post-completion practical training.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Authorization for this type of practical training is for a maximum of 12 months and starts once you have finished your studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You may talk with the international students&#8217; department to get the necessary forms.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">They inform you of the different practical training options. Look for your practical training options when studying to prepare for the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Non-Immigrant H-3 Visa or Trainee Visa</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">An H-3 visa is for applicants who do not have the appropriate educational background or work experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is for people who like to come to the United States to train in a particular field to return to their home country after completing their studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The H-3 visa is valid for two years and cannot be extended or transferred to H-1B/L-1 visas.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To authorize an H-3 visa, the applicant must secure training from an American employer with an established training program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Non-Immigrant H-1B Visa or Specialty Occupation Visa</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The minimum conditions for obtaining this visa include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">a US employer to sponsor the applicant,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">an American Bachelor&#8217;s Degree or its equivalent,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">a correlation between the job responsibilities and the applicant&#8217;s education and work experience.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is also necessary to endorse a labor condition attestation from the Department of Labor before filing the H-1B requisition with the Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">An LCA must ensure that foreign workers are not exploited by American employers and have the same salaries and benefits as their American counterparts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The H-1B is for three years and can be extended for another three years but cannot be extended beyond six years.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Spouses and children automatically get H-4 visas, allowing them to accompany the applicant and attend an institute in the US, but not work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Non-Immigrant R-1 Visa or Religious Worker Visa</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The R-1 religious worker class is for ministers, people working in a professional capacity in a religious job, or people working for a religious organization in a ministerial position.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The applicant must demonstrate that they had been a member of the religious denomination for at least two years preceding the application.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Initial admission lasts three years with an extension of up to 2 years. The American employer is required to demonstrate that it has tax exemption status.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Non-Immigrant E-1/E-2 Visa or Treaty Trader/Treaty Investor Visa</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Some countries have treaties with the US, allowing their citizens to get treaty trader/investor visas.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A fundamental necessity for an E-1 visa is that at least 51% of the corporation&#8217;s trade must be between the US and the given country.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">An E-2 visa requires a considerable investment into a new or existing enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Managers, executives, and other essential employees are qualified for these visas. The visa is usually for five years with two years increments upon each entry.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is possible to expand these visas as long as there is a need for the person to direct the United States enterprise and the concern remains possible.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Non-Immigrant L-1 Visa or Intracompany Transfer Visa</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The L-1 intracompany transferee visa is for foreign companies with offices in the United States, which like to transfer some employees to this country for temporary employment undertakings.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This visa is for managers and executives, with maximum admission of 7 years or people having specialized knowledge, with maximum admission of 5 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If the US subsidiary is a newly established office, the applicant will only be admitted for one year.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is possible to apply for attachments, accompanied by documentation showing meaningful or future business activity and increased personnel.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is feasible to apply for permanent residency as a multinational manager through this category.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Non-Immigrant Obtaining a Green Card</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A person granted permanent residency, known as green card status, can live, work, and study in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Depending on their category, an immigrant may be qualified to file for US citizenship either three years or five years from the date of acquiring permanent residency.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is possible to have a green card after graduation and get a permanent residency position under four main classes in the US. The easiest way is through a family relationship where the petitioner is either an American citizen or permanent resident.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The other categories include employment sponsorship, diversity immigrants, and refugees. You might also take your luck with the Green Card Lottery.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">F-1 Visa to Green Card | Green Card after Graduation</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Now let us look at some options to change your <a href="https://www.internationalstudent.com/immigration/f1-student-visa/">F-1 visa</a> to a Green Card to help you decide which path fits you best.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">What is an F-1 Visa?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The F-1 visa is for international students in the United States for higher education or attending the English Language Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">They are usually may remain in the country until they have completed their full-time academic courses of study at approved educational institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Technically, the F-1 visa is for applicants who intend to return to their home country upon completing their studies unless they participate in the post-completion OPT (optional practical training).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This program allows international students to participate in their central study area for one year following graduation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">International students with degrees in particular STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) may be eligible for a 24-month extension of their post-completion OPT authorization to work.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">However, the F-1 visa holder is still expected to return to their home country after the degree, OPT, or STEM OPT program is completed, unless they become a permanent resident of the US.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">F-1 visa to EB-1 Visa | Green Card after Graduation</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">One option for students in the United States on F-1 visas and who wish to become Green Card holders is to get an EB-1 visa, also known as first-preference employment-based US visas.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This visa is for international students and foreign nationals with extraordinary abilities, including the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Recipients of an Olympic medal, Oscar, or Pulitzer Prize</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Outstanding researchers or professors</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Multinational managers and executives</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Unique abilities in the arts, business, or sciences fields,</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">For applicants based on extraordinary abilities, they must also meet at least three out of 10 of the following criteria:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Receipt of nationally or internationally respectful prizes or awards for excellence;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Membership in associations in the field demand outstanding achievement of their members;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Published works about the applicant in professional or major trade publications;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Evidence of having been asked to judge the work of others, either individually or on a panel;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Original artistic, athletic, or business-related scientific, scholarly contributions of major significance to the field;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Authorship of scholarly papers in professional or major trade publications;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Work displayed at artistic displays;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Performance of a leading or vital role in distinguished organizations;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">A high salary or other relatively high remuneration concerning others in the field;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Commercial successes in the performing arts.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Because many F-1 visa holders usually find it hard to meet the criteria to apply for an EB-1 visa, this option is not often a path to a Green Card.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you want to apply for an EB-1 visa, you can either find a sponsoring employer in your area of specialty or petition for yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you are petitioning through a sponsoring employer, the employer is typically required to pay for your petition and follow the applicable visa and labor laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">For self-petitioners, you are required to file Form I-140, Petition for Alien Worker, and pay the fees yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Because EB-1 visas are typically only for people with exceptional abilities, have contributed significant research, or have multinational positions in companies, it is not easy to be approved unless you meet the requirements indicated above.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;">F-1 to EB-2 or EB-3 Visa</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Suppose you cannot meet the stringent criteria to get a green card after graduation and have the first-preference EB-1 visa.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In this case, you can secure an EB-2 or EB-3 visa, which are the second-and third-preference employment-based immigration visa categories, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">EB-2 visas are reserved for people in the following three categories:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Receiving an offer for a job that requires an advanced degree and holding that degree or a minimum of a bachelor&#8217;s degree and five years of progressive job experience;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Possessing exceptional talent in the arts, business, or sciences;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Having a national interest waiver for the position.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The following criteria apply to EB-2 visa applicants:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Must submit official academic records showing the advanced degree in the field of exceptional ability;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Letters demonstrating work experience in the field of at least ten years;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Commanding a high salary in the field that is commensurate with exceptional ability;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Holding professional licenses or certifications;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Professional association memberships;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Recognition by peers for considerable assistance to the field.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">For an employer-based EB-2 visa, your employer will need to file a Form I-140 and an approved labor certification from the US DOL (Department of Labor).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The EB-3 or third-preference employment-based immigration visa is reserved for skilled workers, professionals, and certain other workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Skilled workers must have a minimum of two years of work experience or training in their fields, labor certification, and an offer of employment for a permanent, full-time position.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">There are no American citizens available to fill it. Moreover, professionals must hold at least a bachelor&#8217;s degree and a job offer in their field.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Unskilled workers must perform unskilled labor in the US for which American workers are not available and hold job offers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Sponsoring employers of EB-3 applicants must file labor certifications and Forms I-140 on behalf of the applicants.</span></p>

This post has all you need to know, plus updated information about the travel ban for international students in 2022. Let&#8217;s get to them.</span></p>

<li><span style="color: #333333;">Conclusion</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">How do Indian Students Go to Canada During the Pandemic?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It&#8217;s a complicated journey for Indian students heading to colleges in Canada, which costs much more than they usually think.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Flying to Canada has become more protracted and more expensive due to the extension of the ban on direct flights from India.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Ottawa recognizes Covishield, the Covid-19 vaccine taken by most Indians, but they must do the compulsory Corona Virus test before arriving in Canada in a third country.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Issuing a visa takes more time due to rising travel demand, say, education consultants, helping more than a thousand students get admission in Canadian universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The HCC (High Commission of Canada) in New Delhi acknowledged the negative effect of the pandemic on the processing time for study permits. The high commission says in this regard:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&#8220;For study permit still in process, we cannot guarantee that students will receive a decision on their application or be able to go to Canada before the semester begins.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This process cannot be expedited given the high volumes of passports we are currently receiving each week.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">However, experts say it is not dampening the Indian students&#8217; interest in Canada for higher education. One of the main attractions is perpetual residency offered to Indian students after getting some work experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Canada is a dreamy educational destination for thousands of international students; however, there are several hurdles they need to clear before they travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">An essential one is the Canadian Student visa. Currently, Indian students traveling to Canada have to take third-country routes, which causes more expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Before applying for a Canadian visa, students should do some research. Here are a few essential points students should have before they apply for their visa:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Canada Visa Requirements for Indians</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Lockdown due to Covid-19 and travel restrictions have contributed to a considerable delay in visa processing for specific countries, which has disrupted students&#8217; travel plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Universities and consultants recommend that students who have received their Canadian student permits either usually or via SDS shouldn&#8217;t delay applying for their permits and visas.</span></p>
<p>Here are common reasons for student visa rejection in the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://abroadin.com/blog/student-visa-rejection-22-common-reasons/"><strong>Common Reasons for Student&#8217;s Visa Rejection</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">University Acceptance Letter</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The acceptance letter is a must-have requirement for the visa process. So the first step of the visa application process is to shortlist the top universities that suit a person&#8217;s profile and scores.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It&#8217;s important to shortlist at least three different universities with several backup options.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Tip: You can categorize universities into three categories, including Dream, Reach, and Safe. This method helps students sort through options and makes it easy to decide.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">However, before you apply to a Canadian university, make sure it is a DLI (Designated Learning Institution).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Student Permit; Visa Requirements for Indians</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This document is issued to international students who want to study at Designated Learning Institutions in Canada. Without this, students are allowed to enter Canada.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Direct Study Stream</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Department of Immigration, Refugee, and Citizenship Canada launched the Direct Study Stream (SDS) program.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">While the usual process of a student visa may take up to 2 to 3 months, the SDS program allows students from some countries, including India, to get their visa in 4 to 6 weeks or even less time.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Required Documents for Indian Students</span></h3>

<li><span style="color: #333333;">A valid passport,</span></li>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">5 Important Things About Visa Requirements for Indians</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">International students, including students from India who are planning to continue their studies in Canada, should have some essential things in their minds. These are five important ones:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Application Mode</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The CIC (Citizenship and Immigration Canada) website allows students to apply online for their Canadian student visa, especially during the pandemic. Things are quicker this way, and students get updates on their applications directly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Visa Requirements for Indians</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If students have a family member working in Canada or is applying for a Canadian work permit, the student visa application will be processed in about two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If this is not the case, we have to wait for about three months for the standard Canadian Student Visa processing time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Language Requirements for Visa</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Canadian colleges and universities need all international students to prove proficient in English. They accept IELTS, TOEFL, and Cambridge English: Advanced.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The minimum IELTS score should be 6.5, with a minimum score of 6.0 in each category.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Biometrics Appointment and Visa Interview</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Indian applicants should have their biometrics taken, and the fee is about 85 CAD, which is an additional cost. Depending on the requirement, the applicant should have an interview at a local Visa Application Center, for which there is a small charge.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Visa Requirements for Indians Restrictions and Quarantine</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you plan to study abroad for the first time, it&#8217;s suggested to check the relevant university website for Covid-19 related updates. Conditions are changing with little notice.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Travel Restrictions and Covid-19 Pandemic</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In 2020, when students worldwide could not travel to Canada due to travel restrictions, the Canadian government created policies that reassured Indian students.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">They said Indian students would be allowed to pursue online courses from their own countries but still eligible for a Post-Graduation Work Permit after moving to Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In light of the outbreaks, maybe Canada will extend the travel restrictions and ban flights from India; however, given the government measures in the past, international students need not worry about their fate when studying in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To enter Canada as an international student from India, you must meet the following requirements:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Have a study permit or a letter of introduction proving you were approved for a study permit;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Be attending a designated learning institution with a Covid-19 readiness plan approved by its region.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Even if you are qualified as a fully vaccinated international student, you must have about two weeks of quarantine plan before arriving in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The border services officers will decide on whether you are qualified as a fully vaccinated person.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Canada&#8217;s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan supports those facing hardship to Corona Virus. International students may be qualified for some programs, such as the CRB (Canada Recovery Benefit).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Note that some programs may not be available to international students, including students from India.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1520" src="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/top-view-visa-application-arrangement-1.jpg" alt="Visa Requirements for indians" width="1095" height="730" srcset="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/top-view-visa-application-arrangement-1.jpg 1095w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/top-view-visa-application-arrangement-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/top-view-visa-application-arrangement-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/top-view-visa-application-arrangement-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1095px) 100vw, 1095px" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Requirements for Exempt People</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">There are some stringent requirements you have to meet even if you are exempt from quarantine. In this manner, you have to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">wear a proper mask always when in public places;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">get a list of all contacts for your first two weeks in Canada;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">control yourself for signs and symptoms of Covid-19;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Although your reason for entering Canada may fall under an exemption, you may still have to follow certain provincial and territorial restrictions, depending on your destination, which may include quarantine.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">PGWP Eligibility; Visa Requirements for Indians</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you&#8217;re an international student residing inside Canada, you&#8217;re still qualified for the PGWP (post-graduation work permit) if:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">your in-person classes in Canada have been moved to an online-only format; you take classes online because of Covid-19, or</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">you had to put your studies on hold, or study part-time during the winter, spring, or summer semesters because of Covid-19.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Canada has taken some unique action to restrict the spread of the Corona Virus, based on the public health measures introduced by the PHAC (Public Health Agency of Canada). The CBSA (Canada Border Services Agency) and PHAC have put in place enhanced health and safety measures to help prevent the pandemic while continuing to support the movement of essential workers and goods across the border.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you seek visa requirements for Indians on the web, we gathered almost everything you need to know as an international student, especially students from India, about Canadian student visas during Covid-19.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">What is Dependent Visa</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A dependent Visa permits the spouses and children to travel abroad and join the family member with a corresponding Visa.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Partner or spouse and children may be eligible to apply for a dependent visa if:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">The main visa holder&#8217;s program is full-time, at postgraduate levels, and at least nine months long;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">The main person is a government-sponsored student on a full-time course for six months or longer. It means they should be financially sponsored for studies by the overseas government.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If the requirements outlined above do not apply to your circumstances, family members would be eligible to apply for a dependent visa. In this case, you should be studying in a new country and meet the following specific requirements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Tier4 or general student permission is current, or it expired no more than three months before the new visa application;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Your new course is over six months long;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Family members already have dependent immigration permission, or it expired no more than three months before the new visa application;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Family members simultaneously apply for a dependent visa as a new student visa application.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Dependent visa holders can work in European countries, with some restrictions. They cannot work as a dentist or doctor in training or as a professional athlete, including a coach.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Who Can Come to Europe as a Dependent</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Many European countries allow dependents to join their family member with dependent visas under circumstances and conditions. A dependent for visa purposes is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">A wife, husband, or civil partner,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">A relationship like a marriage, an unmarried partner for at least two years;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">A child under 18 years old.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If the primary person extends their student visa and has children over 18, they may apply for a further permit to stay as a Dependent.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Suppose your wife, husband, civil partner, or unmarried partner applies as a dependent. In that case, the relationship must be honest and exist at the time of application, and you have to intend to live together throughout your stay in your new country.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">For children to be qualified for a dependent visa, it is a requirement that both parents need to be in or coming to a European country. There are a few exceptions to this requirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Families who cannot meet this requirement need to evidence the serious and compelling reasons why the child should be with them in a new country or that you have &#8216;sole responsibility for the child and have made suitable arrangements for the child&#8217;s care.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If your family members are not in a new country or are not eligible to apply for a dependent visa, they could visit you in the country under the standard visitor path. A visitor can generally stay in most European countries for six months.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Apply for Entry Clearance as a Dependent</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">An application for entry clearance for a visa is made from outside a European country. How about applying for Entry Clearance as a dependent from outside the European countries?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Making the Application</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Either dependent can apply when the student is extending, switching their visa, or any time before their current visa expires.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A family member cannot switch to a dependent visa as a visitor or short-term student in the destination country.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Considering the Costs of Dependent Visa</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Fees are charged for each dependent. The application fee is about EUR 420 for the standard service, with an advertised decision timeframe of 15 working days.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It can vary depending on when and where you make your application, particularly in the peak period between July to September.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Dependents must also pay the immigration health surcharge, around EUR 560 per year, for the visa&#8217;s duration.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This fee is different in some European countries. For your destined country, check the governments&#8217; official websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">As part of the visa, application dependents must have sufficient funds to cover living costs. It is about EUR 820 for each month the visa is valid, up to a maximum of 9 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A bank statement can fulfill this requirement, and the funds can be held in the student&#8217;s or the partner&#8217;s name.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The financial documentation must indicate that the required level of funds has been held for a minimum 28-day period, ending no more than 31 days before the applying date.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If the student has official financial sponsorship that covers any dependents&#8217; living costs, a letter from the sponsor proving this can be submitted to fulfill the financial needs. The letter would need to ensure the amount they are providing to cover the living costs for dependents.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Additional financial documentation should be provided if it does not cover the required amount.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Following Deadlines</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Like a student visa, dependents should apply in their country of nationality or residence, where they have permission to live. The application is made online. A different application needs to be completed for each dependent.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In most countries, an appointment is reserved for attending the visa application center, registering in biometrics, and submitting supporting documents as part of the online application.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Required Documents for Dependent Visa</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The applicant must provide the following documents in support of a <a href="https://www.y-axis.com/visa/dependant/">dependent application</a>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Passport,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">TB test certificate if applicable,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Evidence of relationship to the principal applicant,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">The principal applicant&#8217;s decision letter.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Official certified translations must accompany any non-English documents.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Apply for Permission to Stay as a Dependent</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A dependent family member can apply for ILR after five years of living in a European country on a dependent visa. A dependent usually receive a visa that lasts for the same time as the primary visa holder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Following Deadlines</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is suggested that dependents apply while the student is extending or switching their visa. A dependent application can be added to the student visa application, but the application fee is charged for each applicant.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A family member cannot switch to a dependent visa in the European country as a visitor or short-term student.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Considering the Costs of Dependent Visa</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The application fee is around EUR 600 for the standard service in most European countries, which takes up to two months for making the decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Availability for biometrics enrolment appointments is provided for online apply. There are premium services available at a higher cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Dependents must pay the immigration health surcharge, which is charged at about EUR 560 per year for the duration of the visa validation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Suppose a dependent has had a valid visa for a year on the date of the permission to stay application. In that case, evidence of funding does not need to be provided to support the new dependent visa application.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Suppose the dependent has not been in the destined country for a significant part of the previous 12 months. In that case, they may be asked to have evidence of meeting the financial requirements during the visa application process.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If it does not apply, sufficient funds to cover living costs must be held. It is about EUR 820 for each month the new visa is valid, up to a maximum of 9 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The required funds must be held for at least 28 consecutive days before submitting the online application.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The end date of the 28 days has to be within 31 days of the date of application. The extra time granted on the end of the visa from the student&#8217;s course end date is considered in calculating the financial requirement if the course length is less than nine months.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you are applying as a dependent visa under the Doctorate Extension Scheme and have not held a valid visa for at least a year on the date of application, you need to have held funds of at least EUR 1630 for visa application.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Required Documents</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">These documents also should be provided in support of a dependent application:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Passport,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Biometric Residence Permit (BRP),</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Police registration certificate if required,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Evidence of relationship to the principal applicant if the dependent partner or child has not previously been granted permission as a student dependent.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">All documents must be in the English language or be attended by official certified translations.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The Dependent Visa allows the primary visa holder to bring their dependents to a new country and work or study full time once they have the relevant permits. This article discusses all you need to know about the Dependent Visa and its limits in most European countries.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #333333;">If your student visa was rejected the first time, you could re-apply it. Many students get the Student Visa the second time around whose visa applications were denied the first time. However, you should eradicate the reason and apply for your Student Visa again. This guide covers the most fundamental reasons for student visa rejection in the United States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Student Visa Rejection for Country of Origin</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The most decisive factor in the student visa application is the home country. In some cases, the applicant&#8217;s return to a less developed country may be challenging to overpower the odds and receive a student visa.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In general, a student from a politically stable and economically developed country like Germany, in general, should not have any problem. In contrast, applicants from Congo have the odds stacked against them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Applying in Third Country</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is not a discrepancy, but the consul may see a recent immigrant or resident with added suspicion.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">For example, if he moved to the UK from India last year and now wants to study in the United States, the consul may take the approach: &#8220;Come back and apply again when you are more settled in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Unknown Community Colleges</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The institution&#8217;s quality is not considered to factor into a consul&#8217;s decision, but it sometimes does. A consul may be more respectful to a top school applicant than a college student in the middle of nowhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Student Visa Rejection for Poor Grades</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The consul will question the allocation of a visa to a returning student who has a poor academic record in the US. For example, poor grades or poor attendance on an initial F-1 visa.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">The applicant&#8217;s Persona in Social Media</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If the applicant&#8217;s profile in social media shows drug use or a party animal persona, the consul may doubt the seriousness of the student.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Questionable Contact Persons in DS-160</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">For students, the DS-160 asks two contacts. If a contact is on an embassy blocklist or was once denied a United States visa, the negative association impact may appear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Student Visa Rejection for Mistakes in DS-160s Form</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Commonly, the DS-160 should not have any errors, but experience has shown that they happen all of the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Cultural and language differences, simple negligence, and cluelessness about the law can sometimes play an important role here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Visa Refusal Due to Inadmissibility</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">All visa applicants are subject to the public grounds of inadmissibility, including health, criminal, and immigration violations.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">For example, suppose the applicant had a conviction for a serious crime of moral turpitude. In that case, even if it took place ten years ago and was deleted, he is not qualified for a student visa without a nonimmigrant waiver.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1462" src="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/smiley-couple-ready-traveling-with-luggage-1.jpg" alt="student visa rejection" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/smiley-couple-ready-traveling-with-luggage-1.jpg 900w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/smiley-couple-ready-traveling-with-luggage-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/smiley-couple-ready-traveling-with-luggage-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Family and Relatives in the US</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A common question at the interview is about relatives in the US. The DS-160 asks not only for immediate relatives but other relatives too.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A failure to inform the relative in the DS-160 may be a misrepresentation. It leads to a 212(a)(6)(C)(i) finding.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The interview may center on how the relative settled in the United States. Using asylum may entirely exhaust the student visa applicant&#8217;s chances.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If the applicant&#8217;s sibling stayed in the US after an SWT (Summer Work Travel) program, this could also be considered a strike. If a brother or sister is in the US as a student, the consul may suppose it as enough.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Student Visa Rejection for Family Ties</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">For young applicants, their parents&#8217; jobs may become a critical factor in the analysis. If the applicant&#8217;s father is a worker, the applicant may be viewed as a poorer family and thus have more immigration risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">As a part of this living analysis, the consul may minister those from rural areas or small towns with less fidelity and more likely to reject than large cities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">US-based Significant Other as Sponsor</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Suppose the student visa applicant and sponsor in the United States have a romantic relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In that case, this may raise questions about the applicant and sponsor&#8217;s motives: Do they use the student visa as a pretext for moving to this country?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The consul takes a much closer look at the intentions and ties of the applicant and may assume that a fiancée visa is a more appropriate visa.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Dependents Staying at Home</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It may seem counterintuitive to see dependents staying at home as a negative. After all, the applicant is more likely to return country home if his family remains at home, the consul may ask:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">&#8220;If the applicant leaves his occupation and will not be earning a salary, who will support the family financially?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Student Visa Rejection for Inadequate Finance</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The student visa applicant must show the capability to pay for the first year of studies. Consuls posted in developing countries are very careful to fraud in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you bring a bank statement showing the transfer of $50000 on your sponsor&#8217;s bank account three days before the interview, it raises the question of the source and whether the funds are available to pay for the education.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Parent-sponsors holding poorly paid government positions may be subjected to skepticism. Friend sponsors may also raise questions: When was the last time you saw them? How strong is the commitment of this friend?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Technical Issues in Forms</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">An error in the SEVIS system, a failure to enter information, and oversight by a school official, while seemingly trivial, such technical errors can lead to delays and refusals.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is also common sense that one needs to abide by the start date in the I-20. A late application may cause student visa rejection or refusal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Weak DS-160 Status</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The DS-160 does not provide many options to indicate in-depth detail, but where it does, the applicant needs to use the space wisely. A failure to do so may cause student visa rejection or refusal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">For example, suppose a mid-career student visa application for an MBA indicates their duties at their bank as administration, calculating the budget, and being passive at the interview. In that case, the consul may be less than impressed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Student Visa Rejection for Filing of Immigrant Petition I-130</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A visa applicant for whom a petition has been filed could have a problem. There is a DS-160 question that asks it directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Failure to mark the filing of such a petition may cause a permanent ban. Indicating the petition leads to other questions: Where is the applicant in the immigrant visa line? How long ago was the petition filed?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If the applicant is entitled to an immigrant visa shortly, the consular mindset may be that there is no need for applying for a student visa because they will receive an immigrant visa soon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Previously Spent Considerable Time in the US</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">When a visa applicant has previously spent considerable time in the United States, the consul may consider that it is time to spend some time at home to reestablish connections to the home country.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1464" src="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/visa-application-travel-form-concept-1.jpg" alt="student visa rejection" width="750" height="501" srcset="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/visa-application-travel-form-concept-1.jpg 750w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/visa-application-travel-form-concept-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Admissions Process Misrepresentations and Mistakes</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Another ripe area for potential misrepresentation is when a consul searches into an applicant&#8217;s credentials. For example, suppose university enrollment is contingent on passing a particular exam, and the applicant applies for a visa with an already-issued I-20.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In that case, the consul may doubt whether the university is aware of the applicant&#8217;s missing qualifications. Was it a university administration, or did the applicant raise false academic records to the given university?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Student Visa Rejection for Working Illegally in the US</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is a no-brainer for the consul for a student visa applicant who had previously worked illegally in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Not only did the visa applicant engage in illegal manners, but this probably echoes poor finances and a lack of economic connections to the home. This visa applicant will not be receiving a student visa.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">An arrest in the United States will also trigger a visa revocation, and at the very least, serious problems trying to overwhelm 214(b).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Also, A student must comply with numerous rules and regulations while in the US, such as minimal coursework, restrictions on employment, and reporting needs for changing an address. Failure to accept these rules may lead to student visa rejection or refusal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Interview Problems</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Student visa interviews usually take 2 to 3 minutes, so the applicant only gets one chance to make a first impression. While a consul is not considered to review the applicant&#8217;s English language, insufficient English is factored in any way.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Inability to articulate reasons for selecting the college or university may be destructive. Answering simple, everyday questions are problematic, as are long, unrelated, rambling answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The applicant&#8217;s personality at the interview is also essential: lethargy, passivity, or a failure to show endeavor can tip the scales against the applicant. Nerves, poor language, looking down, negative vibes, or poor dress, are all negative factors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Previous Visa Denial</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">While a recent previous US student visa rejection is not a death knell for a visa applicant, it is a distinct black mark. You can be confident that the consul will review the reason for the visa denial and see if that translates to the student visa application.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">For example, suppose you had applied for a visa to visit the United States to attend a friend&#8217;s wedding. In that case, it is possible that a lack of ties factored into the denial and also led to a student visa rejection in the US.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Student Visa Rejection for Status Changing in the United States</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">After arriving in the United States, many tourists, visitors, and Summer Work Travel participants decided to stay and enroll in school. They change their status and attend school.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">However, they fail to anticipate the greeting they will receive at the Embassy when they return to their home country to apply for a student visa. They are not considered returning students, permitted to deference, but first-time student visa applicants.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In the worst-case scenario, the consul feels deceived by the failure to return home after the reverse of their initial status and slap a 212(a)(6)(C)(i) finding on the applicant.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Another consul may deny under Section 214(b). Regardless of how long the person studied, how little time is left, or money spent on the unfinished education.</span></p>
