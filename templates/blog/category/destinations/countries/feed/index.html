<p>For many immigrants, the dream of becoming a US citizen represents a chance to solidify their place in America. But what exactly is naturalization, and what are the steps to take this transformative step? This Abroadin article explores all you need to know about US passports for permanent residents and US citizenship requirements and application process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Naturalization?</li>
<li>What are the Advantages of US Passports for Permanent Residents?</li>
<li>What are the US Citizenship Requirements?</li>
<li>What is the US Citizenship Application Process?</li>
<li>How to Renew US Passports for Permanent Residents?</li>
<li>Tips for Getting US Passports for Permanent Residents</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is Naturalization?</h2>
<p>Naturalization is when someone who wasn&#8217;t born in the United States becomes a US citizen. Only certain immigrants can do this process, those who have a green card; which means they&#8217;re permanent residents. They can apply for 3 to 5 years or meet specific military service requirements.</p>
<p>If you have a green card, you can apply for citizenship after being a five-year resident. It is the most common way people become US citizens.</p>
<p>To qualify, you need to have lived in the US continuously for five years before you apply using Form N-400, Application for Naturalization. The Immigration and Nationality Act (Title III, Chapter 2) explains all the requirements for someone who&#8217;s been a permanent resident.</p>
<p>It takes about nine months from applying for citizenship to becoming a citizen at the Oath of Allegiance ceremony. Let’s talk about the advantages of US passports for permanent residents in the next section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What are the Advantages of US Passports for Permanent Residents?</h2>
<p>Citizenship means being born to US citizens or completing the naturalization process. This status brings new opportunities and responsibilities for the people who can successfully achieve it.</p>
<p>As a citizen, you get a US passport, allowing visa-free travel to many countries and access to assistance from US embassies or consulates in emergencies. You also have the freedom to travel without restrictions, but it&#8217;s wise to check visa requirements beforehand.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voting rights:</strong> With citizenship, you can vote in national elections.</li>
<li><strong>Running for office:</strong> You can run for government positions as a citizen.</li>
<li><strong>No more immigration paperwork:</strong> Once you&#8217;re a citizen, you don&#8217;t need to deal with immigration forms anymore—there are also no more fees, renewals, or reporting to the government when you move.</li>
<li><strong>Better job prospects:</strong> Only citizens can work for the US government, which usually means higher pay and benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Access to government programs:</strong> As a citizen, you can access federal assistance programs like Social Security and Medicare and apply for federal college aid.</li>
<li><strong>Protection from deportation:</strong> Once you&#8217;re a citizen, you can&#8217;t be deported unless there&#8217;s fraud involved in your application.</li>
<li><strong>Sponsoring family members:</strong> You can help family members get permanent residence in the US.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic citizenship for children:</strong> Your kids become citizens automatically, even if born outside the US. Just inform the nearest US embassy or consulate.</li>

<h2>What are the US Citizenship Requirements?</h2>
<p>Before you apply for naturalization, you must meet specific eligibility requirements. Depending on your situation, different requirements may apply to you. These are the basic US citizenship requirements you should meet:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must be at least 18 years old when you apply using Form N-400, Application for Naturalization.</li>
<li>You must prove that you&#8217;ve been a legal permanent resident in the US for at least five years.</li>
<li>You must have lived continuously in the US for five years right before you apply using Form N-400.</li>
<li>Before applying, you must have been physically present in the US for at least 30 months out of those five years.</li>
<li>You must have lived in a state or USCIS district for at least three months before applying.</li>
<li>You must show good moral character for at least five years before applying.</li>
<li>You must commit to the ideals of the US Constitution.</li>
<li>You should be able to understand basic English, read, write, and speak it.</li>
<li>You should know about US history, government principles, and civics.</li>
<li>You have to take an Oath of Allegiance to the US.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on their age and how long they&#8217;ve been a legal permanent resident, some people don&#8217;t need to take the English test for citizenship. They can take the civics test in their preferred language.</p>
<p>Check the accommodations page or the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-12">USCIS Policy Manual Citizenship and Naturalization Guidance</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>What is the US Citizenship Application Process?</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re applying for US passports for permanent residents for the first time in the United States, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 1: Fill out Form DS-11</h3>
<p>Start the US citizenship application process by completing <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/forms.html">Form DS-11: Application for a US Passport</a>. You can download and print this form or fill it out online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 2: Show Proof of US Citizenship</h3>
<p>You need to provide evidence of your US citizenship. If you&#8217;ve recently become a citizen through naturalization, you can use your Certificate of Naturalization. If you don&#8217;t have this certificate, you can use other documents.</p>
<p>Check the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/citizenship-evidence.html">State Department&#8217;s Citizenship Evidence</a> for examples and tips on gathering your documents in the US citizenship application process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 3: Bring a Valid ID</h3>
<p>You must also bring a valid form of identification and a photocopy of both sides (if the information is printed on the back). Commonly accepted IDs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a state-issued driver&#8217;s license, or</li>
<li>a current foreign passport.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 4: Get a Passport Photo</h3>
<p>Your application must include a passport photo measuring 2 x 2 inches (51 x 51 mm). Make sure the photo meets the requirements outlined <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/photos.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 5: Submit Your Application</h3>
<p>You must apply for your first passport in person at a passport acceptance facility. The US State Department authorizes these facilities, which can be found in places like state government offices, public libraries, and post offices. You can locate the nearest facility <a href="https://iafdb.travel.state.gov/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you know where to go, submit your completed Form DS-11, citizenship evidence, ID photocopy, passport photo, and necessary fees. After submitting your application, you can track its status online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Applying for a Passport from Outside the US.</h3>
<p>Getting a US passports for permanent residents outside the country works differently than applying from within the country. If you&#8217;re a US citizen living abroad, you&#8217;ll usually need to apply for your passport in person at a US Embassy or consulate.</p>
<p>Each embassy or consulate has its own rules and processes for passport services. People living abroad can find more info on their country&#8217;s embassy or consulate website.</p>
<p>The standard processing time for a passport application is currently 8 to 11 weeks. But if you have international travel plans coming up soon or need the passport faster, you can apply for an expedited passport by paying an extra $60 fee.</p>
<p>Expedited passports take 5 to 7 weeks to process, starting when the government gets your application at a passport agency or center.</p>

<h2>How to Renew US Passports for Permanent Residents?</h2>
<p>US passports for adults usually last 10 years, while passports for kids under 16 are good for 5 years. Know when your passport expires and learn about the renewal process before it&#8217;s time to update it.</p>
<p>While the steps might change depending on your situation, here&#8217;s the usual process for renewing your passport by mail at your nearest United States Post Office:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 1: Fill out the Renewal Application</h3>
<p>Start by completing <a href="https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds82_pdf.pdf">Form DS-82: US Passport Renewal Application for Eligible Individuals</a>. You can either do this on paper at the post office or online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 2: Include Necessary Documents</h3>
<p>Along with Form DS-82, you&#8217;ll need to send in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your most recent US passport book and card.</li>
<li>A passport photo that meets the requirements.</li>
<li>Certified copies of documents if your name has changed since your last passport.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 3: Pay Fees and Mail Your Application</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to pay the renewal fees with a personal check or money order, as online payments aren&#8217;t accepted for passport services. Include the check or money order when you mail your completed application and the documents mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>To determine your renewal fees and where to send your application, check out the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport.html">State Department&#8217;s renewal info</a> page.</p>

<h2>Tips for Getting US Passports for Permanent Residents</h2>
<p>Before you start the journey to becoming a US citizen, it&#8217;s crucial to understand the primary responsibilities that come with it. Here are some essential things to know:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Renouncing Other Citizenship</h3>
<p>You might have to give up citizenship in other countries. Depending on your home country&#8217;s rules regarding dual citizenship (being a citizen of two countries at once), you might need to relinquish your citizenship when you become American.</p>
<p>The US allows dual citizenship, but you&#8217;ll typically need to use your US passport for travel in and out of the country. Some countries, like Australia, Canada, and the UK, also allow dual citizenship. However, others, like India and Japan, may require you to give up their citizenship once you become American.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s wise to check your home country&#8217;s policy on dual nationality before applying for naturalization if you plan to keep your citizenship there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Military Service</h3>
<p>Although the draft for mandatory military service ended in 1973, it could be reinstated. If it does happen, as a US citizen or green card holder aged 18 to 25 who has lived in the US, you must register with the Selective Service System.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Jury Duty</h3>
<p>In the US, serving on a jury when called is mandatory. You must attend if you receive a summons, although you might not ultimately serve. Only those chosen by the judge and attorneys after being summoned will serve on the jury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Exemptions from Federal Jury Duty</h3>
<p>Active-duty military personnel, professional firefighters and police officers, and some full-time public government officials are usually exempt from federal jury duty.</p>
<p>Individuals who served on a federal jury in the past two years, those aged 71 and older, and volunteer first responders may request excused, but policies vary by district court.</p>
<p>State and local courts have exemption rules based on age, disability, or public office positions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Lifetime US Income Tax Filing Requirement</h3>
<p>US citizens are required to file US income tax returns for life, regardless of where they reside.</p>
<p>If you live abroad, you can exclude a portion of your income—currently over $100,000—from taxation if you meet specific requirements. Any income above this limit is usually subject to taxation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Scrutiny of Criminal History</h3>
<p>Your criminal record will undergo a thorough examination during the naturalization process.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve committed a crime that could lead to deportation, such as immigration fraud, drug offenses, or domestic violence, it&#8217;s crucial to seek legal advice before applying for citizenship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Becoming a US citizen unlocks a path to more significant opportunities and civic engagement. From voting rights and unrestricted travel to federal benefits and job prospects, naturalization offers a complete chance to integrate into American life. However, this privilege comes with responsibilities like taxes and potential military service.

<h2>Student Life in USA Challenges</h2>
As an international student in the US, you&#8217;ll encounter many challenges that will test your resilience, perseverance, and adaptability. These challenges may manifest in various forms, including academic, social, financial, and personal realms.

While these challenges may seem formidable, they also present opportunities for personal growth and development. By confronting these obstacles head-on, students can cultivate essential life skills such as time management, problem-solving, and resilience.

&nbsp;
<h3>Cultural Adjustment</h3>
One of the primary student life in USA challenges is the cultural adjustment they undergo. Relocating to a foreign land with distinct customs, values, and social norms can be overwhelming and stressful.

International students often struggle to adapt to a new culture, which can lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and longing for home.

Some common examples of cultural differences that international students may encounter include:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Communication Styles:</strong> Communication preferences vary across cultures, with some favoring direct communication and others preferring indirect approaches. This variance can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations during conversations.</li>
 	<li><strong>Social Norms:</strong> Customs concerning personal space, eye contact, and body language differ from one culture to another. For instance, direct eye contact may be considered disrespectful in some cultures, whereas it signifies respect in others.</li>
 	<li><strong>Food and Diet:</strong> International students may struggle to find familiar food or may find that American cuisine differs significantly from what they&#8217;re accustomed to. It can pose a challenge, especially for those with dietary restrictions or specific preferences.</li>
 	<li><strong>Holidays and Festivities:</strong> Celebrations and holidays in the US may differ from those in the student&#8217;s home country. This adjustment can be particularly tough, mainly if the student is accustomed to celebrating specific occasions with loved ones back home.</li>

Homesickness is a common challenge for international students, especially those who are studying in the US for the first time and are far from their family and friends.

It can bring about feelings of sadness, loneliness, and even depression, impacting both academic performance and overall well-being. Here are some ways homesickness might show up for international students:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Missing Loved Ones:</strong> People often feel a strong longing for the people left behind in their home country. Difficulty forming new connections in the US can worsen these feelings.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cultural Isolation:</strong> Feeling out of place and struggling to find communities that share similar cultural backgrounds and values can make maintaining a sense of identity hard.</li>
 	<li><strong>Adjusting to Differences:</strong> The process of adapting to a new country, language, and culture can be overwhelming. It can lead to feelings of disorientation or culture shock, making it challenging to feel at home.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Language Barrier</h3>
Even if students are good at English, dealing with accents, slang, and idiomatic expressions they&#8217;re not used to can hinder effective communication with peers and instructors.

Feeling uneasy about speaking English in social situations might make it hard to make friends or join extracurricular activities. It can also make it challenging to engage in class discussions, group projects, and other activities.

<p><span style="color: #333333;">Suppose you have been accepted to study at a German university, recognized institution, university of Applied Sciences, college of Arts and Music, or a similar higher education institution. In that case, you can apply for a German student visa.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">This German student visa for Indian students is for full-time university studies or preparatory courses, like foundation courses.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">With a German student visa, you have an initial 3-month stay in Germany. During this period, you must apply for a residence permit to study. This permit can last up to two years, and you can extend it based on the duration of your studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here are the types of studies you can pursue with a German student visa:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Full-time academic studies.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">German language courses for studies.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Propaedeutic course.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Mandatory preliminary internship.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">State preparatory college &#8216;Studienkolleg&#8217;: This is for foreigners whose school-leaving certificate is not recognized in Germany. After completing the course, you&#8217;ll take the &#8220;Feststellungsprüfung&#8221; test. Passing this test gives you a university entrance qualification certificate, allowing you to apply for university admission in Germany.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In addition, Indian students can do the following activities having a German student visa:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Extend Visa: Apply for an extension of the student residence permit if you still need to finish your planned studies within the visa period and complete them reasonably.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Part-Time Job: Work part-time for up to 120 working days per year. It includes working part-time in an academic institution where you are studying. However, your work should be fine with your study progress.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Residence Permit for Job-Seeking: Apply for a residence permit for job-seeking after graduation. It is available if you&#8217;ve completed your studies in Germany. With this permit, you can search for a job or become self-employed for up to 6 months after graduation. You may also take temporary jobs while looking for a permanent job related to your academic qualification.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">However, there are things you may not do with such a visa:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Full-Time Job: You cannot engage in a full-time job that requires 240 working days per year. While you&#8217;re a student, you do not qualify to apply for a work permit for a full-time job.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Abandon Study: You must continue study lessons. Participate in study lessons to avoid the cancellation of your eligibility to remain in Germany.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">What are the German Student Visa for Indian Students Requirements?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To apply for a German student visa for Indian students you need the following documents:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">National Visa Application Forms: Fill out two forms.</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">How much are Visa Fees and Bank Balance for German Student Visa?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Indian students applying for a <a href="https://www.mygermanuniversity.com/articles/Student-Visa-Germany-From-India#:~:text=Depending%20on%20the%20individual%20cases%20(largely%20on%20the%20residence%20and,in%20Mumbai%2C%20German%20Consulate%20in">German student visa</a> are required to pay fees based on their age:</span></p>
<ul>

<li><span style="color: #333333;">Applicants over 18 years old: INR 6840</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The German Embassy/Consulate requires Indian students to deposit INR 10 lakh into a blocked bank account when applying for a student visa to Germany.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You may get a German student visa without a blocked account, too. However, you should meet one of these conditions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Parent&#8217;s Financial Documents: Submit your parent&#8217;s documents certifying their income and financial assets.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Guarantee from a Friend or Relative: A friend or relative with permanent residence in Germany is guaranteed to cover your living expenses.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Scholarship Award Notification: Present a scholarship award notification from a recognized institution.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you can&#8217;t fulfill these requirements, having a blocked account becomes a mandatory prerequisite for obtaining a German student visa for Indian students to study in Germany.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">What are the Steps to Apply for a German Student Visa for Indian Students?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Here is a simplified step-by-step guide for Indian students applying for a German student visa:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Step 1: Open a Blocked Bank Account</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Open a blocked bank account to show proof of financial resources. You can do this online through approved providers like Expatrio or the Indian branch of a valid German bank.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Step 2: Complete the Visa Application Form</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Fill out the &#8220;Application for a National Visa&#8221; form online or download and complete a PDF copy from the German Mission in India. Have your ID card and passport ready.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Step 3: Take Biometric Visa Pictures</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Take passport-size pictures with a white background and 35mm x 45mm dimensions. Most photo studios in major Indian cities are familiar with German visa photo requirements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Step 4: Collect Required Documents</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Gather all required documents on the &#8220;Checklist for a German national visa – student.&#8221; Download and submit a copy of the checklist with your date and signature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Step 5: Make an Appointment with the German Embassy</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Schedule an appointment with the German Mission in India responsible for your jurisdiction. It can be done online or through VFS Global.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Step 6: Get a Visa Fee Demand Draft</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Pay the visa fee through a Demand Draft at the end of your visa appointment. German Missions accept Demand Drafts from all nationalized banks in India.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Step 7: Submit the Application, Attend the Interview, and Pay the Visa Fee</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Attend your appointment on time with all necessary documents. Participate in a visa interview with an Embassy/Consulate officer who will ask about your trip and study plans. Pay the visa fee at the end of the appointment.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2082" src="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/visa-application-different-countries-arrangement.jpg" alt="german student visa for indian students" width="821" height="548" srcset="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/visa-application-different-countries-arrangement.jpg 821w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/visa-application-different-countries-arrangement-300x200.jpg 300w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/visa-application-different-countries-arrangement-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 821px) 100vw, 821px" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">How Long Does It Take to Issue German Student Visa?</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">After the visa interview, the processing time for a decision from the Embassy/Consulate in India typically ranges from 15 to 30 working days.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">However, this duration may vary depending on the Embassy&#8217;s workload and whether additional documents are required.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It&#8217;s worth noting that some Indian students, as shared on online forums, have reported waiting periods of four to six weeks, and sometimes even up to 12 weeks, to receive a decision on their visa.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Once you have obtained your student visa, you can <a href="https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/india/germany/student-visa/#:~:text=The%20German%20student%20visa%20fee,Republic%20of%20Germany%2C%20New%20Delhi">travel to Germany</a>. You can apply for a student residence permit at the Foreigners&#8217; Registration Office upon arrival. This additional permit is necessary to reside in Germany for your studies legally.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">What should Students do upon coming to Germany?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Before starting your studies in Germany, there are several essential steps to follow:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Firstly, secure permanent accommodation in Germany, whether it&#8217;s a student residence, shared flat, or a rented apartment. Having proof of a permanent address will be crucial for various future requirements.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Next, ensure you have health insurance coverage through a German health insurance policy. It is mandatory for everyone residing in Germany.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Enroll in studies to obtain the certificate of enrollment. Graduate at the student service office during the specified enrollment period mentioned in your admission letter. The certificate of enrollment is essential for address registration, residence permit applications, and obtaining discounts.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">To enroll at a German university as an Indian, you&#8217;ll need a valid national passport with a valid student visa, a letter of admission, recent passport photographs, and student health insurance.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">The next step is opening a current bank account with a recognized German bank. This account will be used for various payments, including rent, study fees, registration fees, and other bills. It&#8217;s also necessary to receive subsidies or your salary.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Register your living address at the Resident&#8217;s Registration Office or Citizen&#8217;s Bureau within one week of finding permanent housing. Upon completion of the application, you&#8217;ll receive a confirmation of registration.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Finally, apply for a residence permit for your studies at the Foreigners&#8217; Registration Office once you have the registration confirmation. It should be done while holding a valid German student visa for Indian students in 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It is a complete guide to getting a German student visa for Indian students in 2024.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">2. Globally Recognized Degrees</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The US education system&#8217;s outstanding academic standards and dynamic curriculum attract students globally, offering a world-class education and exceptional career prospects.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">According to <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.iie.org/research-initiatives/open-doors/">the Institute of International Education&#8217;s Open Doors Report</a>, international student enrollment in the US increased by 15.3% in the 2021-2022 academic year. In this period:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">There were 947,929 international students in the United States.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">The top five countries of origin for international students were China, India, Nepal, Brazil, and Canada.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">International students contributed $45.8 billion to the US economy.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">The top five fields of study were business, engineering, mathematics and computer science, health professions, and physical and life sciences.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Almost 54% of international students who graduated stayed in the US for work or further studies.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">3. Diverse Career Opportunities</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Choosing an international degree from the US not only expands global exposure but also unlocks a variety of career paths.</span></p>

A <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2019">2019 QS World University Rankings survey</a> showed that 72% of international students from US universities worked in a foreign country in the past five years.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">These are some data regarding internships and hands-on experience:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Internship Participation:</strong> According to <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.iie.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SpringSnapshot_Final.pdf">the IIE</a>, 96% of international students at US universities participate in internships or other forms of experiential learning.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Impact on Employment:</strong> An <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.naceweb.org/talent-acquisition/candidate-selection/internship-experience-the-top-differentiator-when-choosing-between-otherwise-equal-job-candidates/">NACE study</a> found that 82% of employers consider internship experience &#8220;very important&#8221; when hiring recent graduates.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Salary Benefits:</strong> Internships can lead to higher salaries.

</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The overall impact of an international degree from the US and why study in the USA as an international student include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Economic Contribution:</strong> International students contribute billions to the US economy each year. In 2018, they contributed <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.iie.org/news/number-of-international-students-in-the-united-states-hits-all-time-high/">an estimated $44.7 billion</a>, according to the US Department of Commerce.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Cultural Exchange:</strong> International students promote cultural exchange and understanding between the US and other countries.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Global Leadership:</strong> A <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.iie.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/International-Students-in-the-US.pdf">study by the IIE</a> found that 70% of international students who graduated from US universities in the past five years are now in leadership roles in their home countries.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">4. Flexibility in Education, Why Study in the USA</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">US universities set themselves apart by offering various subjects aligned with students&#8217; diverse interests. Unlike in many home countries, students are not pressured to declare their major in the first year of their bachelor&#8217;s program.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The flexibility to choose a major in the second year allows students the time and space to explore their passions, fostering a deeper understanding of their chosen field for future.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><a style="color: #333333;" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/08/24/study-finds-students-benefit-waiting-declare-major">More than 80% of US universities</a> allow students to explore different majors before declaring one, offering the opportunity to take courses in various subjects before deciding on a specific study area. It helps students discover their passions and interests, leading to a more informed decision about their major.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Students take 12 courses on average before declaring a major, providing ample time to explore different subjects and establish a solid foundation in their chosen field.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Students who declare a major later in their undergraduate career often have higher GPAs than those who claim earlier, likely because they&#8217;ve had more time to explore their interests and find a subject they are passionate about.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Flexibility in exploring different majors increases the likelihood of on-time graduation, as students are less likely to switch majors, which can cause delays.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Graduating with a major is passionate about increases career satisfaction, as individuals are more likely to find a job that aligns with their skills and interests.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">These data and statistics highlight the value of educational flexibility in US universities, enabling students to explore their interests, make informed decisions about their major, and graduate with a degree they are passionate about.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;">5. Optimal Return on Investment</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Students often grapple with mounting study loans and escalating interest rates in an era of rapid educational transformation. Choosing a university based on ROI becomes crucial.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">US universities enhance skill sets and promise better returns post-graduation, making them a strategic choice for those seeking a valuable and enduring investment in their education.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">How to Stay in Germany after Studies</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">German residence permit and visa system are easy, efficient, and accessible compared to other European countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Like that, your nationality determines any other EU country&#8217;s access to the German labor market.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If they have a German residence permit that explicitly enables them to work there, EU/EEA and Swiss nationals are permitted.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Citizens of the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea may receive a German residence permit from the applicable foreign authority once they have arrived in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">However, it is essential to note that they may not commence their intended employment until they have the permit.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #333333;">Temporary Residence Permit or German Residence Permit</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A temporary residence permit for Germany, also known as a limited residence permit (Aufenthaltserlaubnis), is the first option for international students to stay in Germany after graduation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Temporary German Residence Permit While Looking for Job</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">As an international student of a German university, you enjoy a more favorable status outside the nationals mentioned earlier than other non-EU citizens do.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Once you complete your studies, your student visa also expires; however, students can get 18 months of a work visa after obtaining their German university degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You need to apply for this permit before your student visa runs out; otherwise, you must return to your home country.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You can use this time to look for a permanent job related to your field of study while working part-time to support yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You can work in Germany as much as you want and choose any job to support yourself over these 18 months; however, expertise in your subject of study is a considerable benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To be eligible for this permission, you must meet the following requirements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Proof of a completed course of studies,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Proof of health insurance coverage,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Proof of sufficient financial means to cover costs of living.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1630" src="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/multiracial-hr-reading-resume-millennial-job-applicant-interview-1.jpg" alt="germany after graduation" width="821" height="548" srcset="https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/multiracial-hr-reading-resume-millennial-job-applicant-interview-1.jpg 821w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/multiracial-hr-reading-resume-millennial-job-applicant-interview-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://abroadin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/multiracial-hr-reading-resume-millennial-job-applicant-interview-1-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 821px) 100vw, 821px" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Jobseekers Visa to Stay in Germany after Graduation</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Suppose you returned to your home country after the course completion and want to return to Germany for career opportunities. In that case, you are eligible for a temporary short time visa for up to six months.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You might consider the various options available during this period due to your educational qualifications.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Remember that this is not a long-term visa or a work permit. It only helps you in your search for a permanent position. You need to apply for this visa in your home country.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You should apply for a separate residence and work permit after being employed for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">To be eligible for this visa option, you must meet the following criteria:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Secure financial means,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Academic or vocational qualification,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Proof of German language competence.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Temporary Residence Permit for Taking up Employment</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">When you get a job offer that matches your qualifications, you can decide whether you wish to apply for a German residency permit to start working or an EU Blue Card to continue your stay in Germany after studies and graduation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">German Residence Permit allows internationals to work in Germany for a specific time, as indicated by their employment contract. If your contract is limited to two years, your approval will be valid for two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You can extend the permit if your employment status remains the same. If you plan to live in the country permanently, this is a better option.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">On the other hand, EU Blue Card allows non-EU nationals who are highly qualified in a profession to work in Germany and the other 25 EU member states.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Those with an IT or STEM background are more likely to receive the EU Blue Card (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you plan to live in another EU country, the EU Blue Card may be more advantageous than a residence permit to find a job.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Both of these residence licenses come with several requirements. Depending on your plans, either the residence permit to work or the EU Blue Card may benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">You must meet the following prerequisites to be awarded this residence permit or EU Blue Card:</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Temporary Residence Permit for Marriage</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you marry a German citizen or someone who possesses a permanent residence permit, you can stay in Germany but still require a residence permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If you are EU/EEA citizens, you can live in Germany as you are entitled to freedom of movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">It would help if you had a German residence permit for employment or an EU Blue Card to work in the country legally.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">If one of you is a legal citizen of an EU/EEA member state and the other is a third-country national, the partner who is not an EU/EEA citizen must apply for a spouse joining their partner&#8217;s residence permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">There is no single German residence permit obtained through marriage, but you will be allowed to remain in the country for family unification.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">Excellent command of the German language at the B1 level is also required for this permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The residence visa will be temporary, but the spouse will be eligible for permanent residency after a few years of marriage (typically two years) and time spent in Germany (three years).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">During this time, the spouse is free to seek work or study visas.</span></p>
